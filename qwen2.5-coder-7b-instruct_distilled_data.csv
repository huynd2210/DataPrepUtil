    - Sample: Yes",SELECT count(*) FROM head WHERE age  >  56,"To solve the problem of finding how many heads of departments are older than 56, we need to follow these logical steps:  1. **Identify the Relevant Tables**: The problem involves counting heads of departments based on their age. We have three tables: `department`, `head`, and `management`. The `department` table contains department details, the `head` table contains details about the heads (including their age), and the `management` table links departments to their respective heads.  2. **Understand the Relationships**:     - The `management` table is crucial as it links departments (`department_ID`) to their heads (`head_ID`).    - The `head` table contains the actual age of each head.  3. **Formulate the Query Objective**:    - We need to count the number of rows in the `head` table where the `age` column is greater than 56.  4. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Start with the `SELECT` statement to specify that we want to count the number of rows.    - Use the `COUNT(*)` function to count all rows that meet the specified condition.    - Use the `FROM` clause to specify the `head` table as it contains the required age information.    - Use the `WHERE` clause to filter the rows where the `age` is greater than 56.  Therefore, the logical steps and reasoning lead us to the following SQL query:   SELECT count(*) FROM head WHERE age > 56 ```  This query counts all the rows in the `head` table where the age of the head is greater than 56, effectively giving us the number of heads of departments who are older than 56.",SELECT count(*) FROM head WHERE age > 56,True
