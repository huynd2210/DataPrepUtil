Here’s how we can approach it:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: We need to find the number of businesses located in Phoenix, Arizona that offer waiter service. This involves filtering businesses by location and by a specific attribute.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**:    - The `Business` table contains information about businesses, including their location (`city` and `state`).    - The `Attributes` table lists different attributes that a business can have, such as ""Waiter Service"".    - The `Business_Attributes` table links businesses to their attributes.  3. **Determine Necessary Joins**:    - We need to join the `Business` table with the `Business_Attributes` table to link businesses with their attributes.    - We also need to join the `Business_Attributes` table with the `Attributes` table to get the attribute names.  4. **Filter by Location**:    - We need to filter businesses to only include those located in Phoenix, Arizona. This can be done by adding a condition on the `city` column in the `Business` table.  5. **Filter by Attribute**:    - We need to identify the attribute for ""Waiter Service"". This involves filtering the `Attributes` table to find the attribute ID corresponding to ""Waiter Service"".    - We then use this attribute ID to filter the `Business_Attributes` table.  6. **Count the Results**:    - After applying the necessary filters and joins, we count the number of distinct business IDs that meet the criteria.  7. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Start by selecting the count of business IDs.    - Perform the necessary joins between `Business`, `Business_Attributes`, and `Attributes`.    - Apply the filters for city and attribute name.    - Ensure the query is logically structured to count only the relevant businesses.  By following these steps, we arrive at the solution:   SELECT COUNT(T1.business_id) FROM Business AS T1 INNER JOIN Business_Attributes AS T2 ON T1.business_id = T2.business_id INNER JOIN Attributes AS T3 ON T2.attribute_id = T3.attribute_id WHERE T1.city LIKE 'Phoenix' AND T3.attribute_name LIKE 'Waiter Service' AND T2.attribute_id = 2;   This query counts the number of businesses in Phoenix that have the ""Waiter Service"" attribute, providing the desired result.",,

This involves checking business hours for each day of the week and ensuring the business is open continuously.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**: Based on the schema provided, the relevant tables for this problem are:    - `Business_Hours`: Contains information about the opening and closing times of businesses.    - `Days`: Provides mapping of day IDs to actual days of the week.    - `Business`: Contains basic information about businesses.    - `Business_Attributes`: Links businesses to their attributes.    - `Attributes`: Provides the names of attributes.  3. **Determine the Criteria for 24/7 Operation**: A business is open 24/7 if it has the same opening and closing time for all days of the week, indicating continuous operation.   4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - **Join Tables**: We need to join `Business_Hours` with `Days` to ensure we are checking all days of the week. Then, join with `Business` to get business details and `Business_Attributes` to link to attributes. Finally, join with `Attributes` to get attribute names.        - **Filter for 24/7 Operation**: Use a condition to check that the opening time is equal to the closing time for all days (indicating 24-hour operation). This can be done by checking if the business has the same opening and closing time for all days of the week (day_id 1 through 7).     - **Group and Select Attributes**: After identifying businesses that meet the 24/7 criteria, group by attribute names to list out the attributes of these businesses.  5. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Start by selecting the attribute names from the `Attributes` table.    - Join `Business_Hours` with `Days` to ensure we cover all days.    - Join `Business` to get business details.    - Join `Business_Attributes` to link to attributes.    - Join `Attributes` to get the attribute names.    - Use a `WHERE` clause to filter businesses that have the same opening and closing time for all days of the week.    - Group by attribute names to list them.  6. **Verify the Solution**: Ensure the query logic correctly identifies businesses open 24/7 and retrieves their attributes. Check for edge cases, such as businesses with incomplete data or special cases in opening hours.  By following these steps, we can logically derive the solution to the problem and ensure the SQL query accurately reflects the requirements.",,

In this case, the problem statement directly provides the category ID as 7.  4. **Join Tables to Associate Businesses with the Fashion Category**:    - Perform an INNER JOIN between `Categories` and `Business_Categories` on `category_id` to filter businesses that belong to the ""Fashion"" category.  5. **Join with Business Table**:    - Join the result with the `Business` table on `business_id` to get details of businesses in the ""Fashion"" category.  6. **Join with Reviews Table**:    - Join the result with the `Reviews` table on `business_id` to access review data for each business.  7. **Filter and Aggregate Data**:    - Use a WHERE clause to filter businesses specifically in the ""Fashion"" category using the category ID (7).    - Use GROUP BY on `business_id` to aggregate review counts for each business.  8. **Order and Limit Results**:    - Use ORDER BY with COUNT of `user_id` from the `Reviews` table in descending order to rank businesses by the number of reviews.    - Use LIMIT 1 to select the business with the most reviews.  9. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Combine all the steps into a single SQL query:            SELECT T3.business_id       FROM Categories AS T1       INNER JOIN Business_Categories AS T2 ON T1.category_id = T2.category_id       INNER JOIN Business AS T3 ON T2.business_id = T3.business_id       INNER JOIN Reviews AS T4 ON T3.business_id = T4.business_id       WHERE T1.category_name LIKE 'Fashion' AND T1.category_id = 7       GROUP BY T3.business_id       ORDER BY COUNT(T4.user_id) DESC       LIMIT 1;        By following these logical steps, we can systematically approach the problem and arrive at the correct SQL query to find the business in the fashion category with the most reviews.",,

A good review is typically considered to be 3 stars or higher.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**:     - The `Reviews` table contains information about the reviews, including the `business_id` and `review_stars`.    - The `Business` table contains information about the businesses, including their `business_id`, `state`, and `stars`.    - The `Business_Categories` table links businesses to their categories through `business_id` and `category_id`.    - The `Categories` table provides the `category_name` for each `category_id`.  3. **Determine Necessary Joins**:    - We need to join the `Reviews` table with the `Business` table to filter businesses located in Arizona (`state = 'AZ'`).    - We then join the `Business` table with the `Business_Categories` table to link each business to its categories.    - Finally, join the `Business_Categories` table with the `Categories` table to get the category names.  4. **Filter for Good Reviews**:    - In the `Reviews` table, filter for reviews with `review_stars` greater than or equal to 3 to consider them as good reviews.  5. **Select Distinct Categories**:    - After filtering and joining, select distinct `category_name` to get a list of categories that have businesses with good reviews in Arizona.  6. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Combine all these steps into a SQL query that performs the necessary joins and filtering.  Here's the SQL query that implements these steps:   SELECT DISTINCT T4.category_name  FROM Reviews AS T1  INNER JOIN Business AS T2 ON T1.business_id = T2.business_id  INNER JOIN Business_Categories AS T3 ON T2.business_id = T3.business_id  INNER JOIN Categories AS T4 ON T3.category_id = T4.category_id  WHERE T2.state LIKE 'AZ' AND T1.review_stars >= 3   This query effectively lists the business categories in Arizona that are associated with businesses receiving good reviews (3 stars or higher).",,

Here's a breakdown of the steps:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement:**    - We need to find the ratio of the best to the worst elite users in 2013. The ""best"" and ""worst"" are likely determined by some metric, such as average star ratings.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns:**    - The `Elite` table contains information about elite users and the years they were considered elite.    - The `Users` table contains user-specific information, including `user_average_stars`, which can be used to determine the ""best"" and ""worst"" users.  3. **Determine the Criteria for Best and Worst Users:**    - Assume that ""best"" users have the highest average star rating (5 stars), and ""worst"" users have the lowest average star rating (1 star).  4. **Filter Data for the Year 2013:**    - We need to focus on elite users for the year 2013. This requires filtering the `Elite` table for `year_id = 2013`.  5. **Join Tables to Gather Necessary Information:**    - Perform an inner join between the `Users` table and the `Elite` table on `user_id` to get the average star ratings of elite users in 2013.  6. **Calculate the Number of Best and Worst Users:**    - Use conditional aggregation to count the number of elite users with an average star rating of 5 (best) and 1 (worst).  7. **Calculate the Total Number of Elite Users in 2013:**    - Count the total number of users who were elite in 2013.  8. **Compute the Ratios:**    - Calculate the ratio of the number of best users to the total number of elite users.    - Calculate the ratio of the number of worst users to the total number of elite users.  9. **Formulate the SQL Query:**    - Use SQL to implement the above logic, ensuring that the division results in a real number (floating point) for precision.  10. **Verify and Validate:**     - Ensure the query logic aligns with the problem requirements and validate the results against expected outcomes.  By following these steps, we can logically derive the SQL query provided in the solution:   SELECT      CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN T1.user_average_stars = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) / COUNT(T2.user_id),      SUM(CASE WHEN T1.user_average_stars = 5 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 1.0 / COUNT(T2.user_id)  FROM      Users AS T1  INNER JOIN      Elite AS T2  ON      T1.user_id = T2.user_id  WHERE      T2.year_id = 2013   This query calculates the ratios of the worst and best elite users in 2013 based on their average star ratings.",,

Here's a breakdown of the thought process:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: The task is to calculate the increment percentage of elite users for each year starting from 2005. This means we need to determine how the number of elite users has increased over the years.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:     - The `Elite` table is crucial as it contains `user_id` and `year_id`, which indicate which users were considered elite in which years.    - The `Years` table could be useful for mapping `year_id` to actual years, but since `year_id` already represents the year directly, we might not need this table.  3. **Determine the Base Year**:     - The problem specifies starting from 2005, so we need to consider 2005 as our base year for calculating increments.  4. **Calculate the Number of Elite Users for Each Year**:    - We need to count the number of unique `user_id`s in the `Elite` table for each `year_id` starting from 2005.  5. **Calculate the Increment Percentage**:    - For each year after 2005, calculate the increment percentage compared to 2005. The formula for increment percentage for a given year `Y` is:      \[      \text{Increment Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of Elite Users in Year } Y - \text{Number of Elite Users in 2005}}{\text{Number of Elite Users in 2005}} \right) \times 100      \]  6. **Implement the SQL Query**:    - Use a `SELECT` statement to count the number of elite users for each year.    - Use a `CASE` statement to differentiate between the base year (2005) and other years.    - Calculate the increment percentage using the formula derived above.  7. **Consider Edge Cases**:    - Ensure that the query handles cases where there might be no elite users in a given year.    - Handle potential division by zero if there are no elite users in 2005.  8. **Write the SQL Query**:    - The provided solution seems to calculate the increment for all years before 2014 as a single value, which might not align perfectly with the problem statement if we need yearly increments. However, the logic can be adapted to calculate yearly increments if needed.  Here's a refined version of the thought process to reach the solution:   SELECT      year_id,      (COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) -       COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN year_id = 2005 THEN user_id ELSE NULL END)) * 100.0 /     COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN year_id = 2005 THEN user_id ELSE NULL END) AS increment_percentage FROM      Elite WHERE      year_id >= 2005 GROUP BY      year_id ORDER BY      year_id;   This query calculates the increment percentage of elite users for each year since 2005, comparing each year to the base year 2005.",,

Here are the logical steps to arrive at the solution:  1. **Understand the Problem Requirements:**    - We need to count how many businesses have been reviewed by user ID 3.    - We also need to calculate how long user ID 3 has been with Yelp.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables:**    - To find the number of businesses reviewed by user ID 3, we need the `Reviews` table, which contains information about reviews, including `business_id` and `user_id`.    - To determine how long user ID 3 has been with Yelp, we need the `Users` table, which contains the `user_yelping_since_year` column.  3. **Determine the Necessary Operations:**    - **Counting Reviews:** We need to count distinct `business_id` entries in the `Reviews` table for user ID 3. This will give us the number of unique businesses reviewed by this user.    - **Calculating Duration:** We need to calculate the difference between the current year and the year the user started yelping (`user_yelping_since_year`).  4. **Formulate the SQL Query:**    - Use an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Reviews` and `Users` tables on the `user_id` column to access both the review and user information.    - Use a `WHERE` clause to filter the results for user ID 3.    - Use `COUNT` to count the number of distinct `business_id` entries for the user.    - Use `strftime('%Y', 'now')` to get the current year and subtract `user_yelping_since_year` to calculate the duration.  5. **Write the SQL Query:**    - The SQL query is structured as follows:            SELECT COUNT(T1.business_id), strftime('%Y', 'now') - T2.user_yelping_since_year      FROM Reviews AS T1      INNER JOIN Users AS T2 ON T1.user_id = T2.user_id      WHERE T1.user_id = 3        6. **Verify the Solution:**    - Ensure that the query correctly counts the number of unique businesses reviewed by user ID 3.    - Verify that the calculation of the duration is accurate by checking the current year and the user's starting year.  By following these steps, we ensure that the solution is logically sound and meets the requirements of the problem.",,

This involves determining how many reviews the user has written and dividing that by the number of years they have been active on the platform.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - The `Users` table contains information about when a user started yelping (`user_yelping_since_year`).    - The `Reviews` table contains information about reviews, including which user wrote each review (`user_id`) and the star rating of each review (`review_stars`).  3. **Determine the Time Span**:    - Calculate the number of years the user has been active. This can be done by subtracting the `user_yelping_since_year` from the current year. The current year can be dynamically obtained using a function like `strftime('%Y', 'now')`.  4. **Count the Total Number of Reviews**:    - Use the `Reviews` table to count how many reviews user ID 3 has written. This can be achieved by filtering the `Reviews` table where `user_id` is 3 and counting the number of entries.  5. **Calculate the Yearly Average**:    - Divide the total number of reviews by the number of years the user has been active. This gives the average number of reviews per year.  6. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Use an SQL query to join the `Users` and `Reviews` tables on `user_id`.    - Filter the results to only include records where `user_id` is 3.    - Count the number of reviews and divide by the number of years since the user started yelping.  7. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - The SQL query is structured as follows:            SELECT COUNT(review_stars) / (strftime('%Y', 'now') - T1.user_yelping_since_year)      FROM Users AS T1      INNER JOIN Reviews AS T2 ON T1.user_id = T2.user_id      WHERE T1.user_id = 3          - This query calculates the total number of reviews by user ID 3 and divides it by the number of years they have been active, providing the yearly average.

This can be done using `COUNT(T1.user_id)` where `T1` is an alias for the `Reviews` table.  5. **Calculate the Number of Distinct Businesses**:    - Determine the number of distinct businesses that have received reviews from elite users. This can be done using `COUNT(DISTINCT T1.business_id)`.  6. **Calculate the Average**:    - To find the average number of reviews per business, divide the total number of reviews by the number of distinct businesses. Use `CAST` to ensure the division results in a real number, not an integer.  7. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Combine all the above steps into a single SQL query:            SELECT CAST(COUNT(T1.user_id) AS REAL) / COUNT(DISTINCT T1.business_id)      FROM Reviews AS T1      INNER JOIN Elite AS T2 ON T1.user_id = T2.user_id;        8. **Verify the Logic**:    - Ensure that the join correctly filters only those reviews written by elite users.    - Confirm that the division correctly calculates the average by dividing the total number of reviews by the number of distinct businesses.

The key tables for this problem are `Business_Categories`, `Categories`, `Reviews`, and `Business`.  2. **Identify Relevant Categories**: Since the problem is specific to the ""Hotels & Travel"" category, we need to identify which businesses fall under this category. This requires joining the `Business_Categories` table with the `Categories` table to filter out businesses that belong to the ""Hotels & Travel"" category.  3. **Join Tables**:     - Start by joining the `Business_Categories` table with the `Categories` table on `category_id` to filter businesses that belong to the ""Hotels & Travel"" category.    - Next, join the resulting table with the `Reviews` table on `business_id` to access review data for these businesses.  4. **Aggregate Review Data**:     - Use `GROUP BY` on `business_id` to aggregate reviews for each business.    - Use `COUNT()` to determine the number of reviews for each business.  5. **Identify Business with Most Reviews**:     - Order the results by the count of reviews in descending order to identify the business with the most reviews.    - Use `LIMIT 1` to select the top business.  6. **Calculate Standard Deviation**:     - Once the business with the most reviews is identified, calculate the standard deviation of the review stars for this business.    - Use the `STDDEV()` function on the `review_stars` column for the identified business.  7. **Write the SQL Query**:     - Construct the SQL query based on the above steps to ensure it retrieves the correct business and calculates the required standard deviation.  By following these logical steps, you can systematically approach the problem and construct an SQL query that addresses the requirements. The solution provided in the problem statement seems to focus on identifying the category with the most reviews, but the logical steps outlined here aim to address the problem as initially described.",,

Here's how one might approach the problem:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: We need to find the correlation between the review stars given by users and the overall star rating of businesses. This involves comparing two sets of data: individual review ratings and the average business rating.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - From the schema, the `Reviews` table contains `review_stars`, which represents the ratings given by users.    - The `Business` table contains `stars`, which represents the average rating of each business.  3. **Determine the Relationship**:    - The relationship between these two tables is through the `business_id`, which is present in both tables. This allows us to join these tables and compare the review stars with the business stars.  4. **Plan the SQL Query**:    - We need to join the `Business` and `Reviews` tables on `business_id` to align each review with its corresponding business.    - Calculate the average review stars for each business to compare with the business's overall star rating.  5. **Calculate Average Review Stars**:    - Use an aggregate function to calculate the average of `review_stars` for each `business_id`.    - This can be achieved by summing up all review stars and dividing by the count of reviews for each business.  6. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Perform an `INNER JOIN` between `Business` and `Reviews` on `business_id`.    - Use `SUM(T2.review_stars)` to get the total review stars for each business.    - Use `COUNT(T1.business_id)` to get the number of reviews for each business.    - Calculate the average review stars by dividing the total review stars by the number of reviews.  7. **Execute and Interpret the Query**:    - The query provided in the solution calculates the average review stars across all businesses.    - This result can then be compared to the `stars` column in the `Business` table to understand the correlation.  8. **Consider Additional Analysis**:    - To find the actual correlation coefficient, further statistical analysis would be needed, potentially using additional SQL functions or exporting the data for analysis in a statistical software package.  By following these steps, we can systematically approach the problem and derive insights into the relationship between user review stars and business star ratings.",,

This implies we need to count the number of businesses that have a status indicating they are operational or active.  2. **Review the Schema**: Examine the provided schema to identify which table contains information about businesses and their active status. The schema includes a table named `Business` which seems relevant to the problem.  3. **Identify Relevant Columns**: Within the `Business` table, look for columns that could indicate whether a business is active. The column named `active` is likely to contain this information.  4. **Determine the Data Type and Values**: Consider the data type and possible values in the `active` column. From the samples, it appears that this column contains boolean-like values (`true` or `false`), indicating whether a business is active.  5. **Formulate the SQL Query**: To count the number of active businesses, we need to filter the `Business` table for rows where the `active` column is `true`. The SQL query should count these rows.  6. **Construct the SQL Query**: Write the SQL query to achieve the desired result. The query should select the count of `business_id` from the `Business` table where the `active` column is `true`.  7. **Consider SQL Syntax and Case Sensitivity**: Ensure that the SQL syntax is correct and consider any case sensitivity in the database system. In some systems, boolean values might be case-sensitive, so using `LIKE 'True'` can help ensure the query matches the correct value.  8. **Final Query**: The final SQL query is:        SELECT COUNT(business_id) FROM Business WHERE active LIKE 'True'      9. **Execute and Verify**: Execute the query and verify the results to ensure it accurately counts the number of active businesses.  By following these steps, we can logically derive the solution to count the number of active businesses in the database.",,

In this case, `city LIKE 'Tempe'`.  4. **Filter by Star Rating**:    - We need to filter businesses based on their star ratings, specifically those that have a rating between 3 and 4.    - Use the SQL `BETWEEN` operator to filter the `stars` column for values between 3 and 4.  5. **Select the Required Output**:    - The problem asks for the `business_id` of the businesses that meet the criteria.    - Use the `SELECT` statement to retrieve only the `business_id` column.  6. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Combine the filters and selection into a single SQL query.    - The final query will look like this:            SELECT business_id       FROM Business       WHERE city LIKE 'Tempe'       AND stars BETWEEN 3 AND 4;        7. **Verify the Solution**:    - Ensure that the query correctly filters businesses based on the specified city and star rating range.    - Double-check the schema to confirm that no additional joins or conditions are necessary.  By following these steps, we can logically derive the solution to the SQL problem, ensuring that we correctly filter and select the necessary data from the database.",,

These columns are `business_id`, `user_id`, and `review_length`.  4. **Formulate the Query**:    - We need to construct a SQL query that selects the `review_length` from the `Reviews` table where both the `user_id` is 60776 and the `business_id` is 1.  5. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Using the information from the previous steps, the SQL query can be written as:            SELECT review_length FROM Reviews WHERE user_id = 60776 AND business_id = 1;        6. **Verify the Query**:    - Ensure that the query is correctly structured to select the desired information. It should filter the reviews by the specified user and business IDs and return the review length.  7. **Consider Edge Cases**:    - Consider if there could be multiple reviews by the same user for the same business and how that might affect the query. In this case, the schema suggests a one-to-one relationship for the given IDs, so the query should work as intended.  By following these logical steps, we can confidently construct the SQL query to solve the problem as specified.",,

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logical reasoning process to arrive at the solution:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement:**    - We need to find the attribute of a business in Scottsdale with a high review count.    - The result should be the attribute name.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables:**    - **Business**: Contains information about businesses, including their city and review count.    - **Business_Attributes**: Links businesses to their attributes.    - **Attributes**: Contains the names of attributes.  3. **Determine the Relationships:**    - The `Business` table can be linked to the `Business_Attributes` table using the `business_id`.    - The `Business_Attributes` table can be linked to the `Attributes` table using the `attribute_id`.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query:**    - Start by selecting the `attribute_name` from the `Attributes` table.    - Use an INNER JOIN to connect the `Business` table with the `Business_Attributes` table on `business_id`.    - Use another INNER JOIN to connect the `Business_Attributes` table with the `Attributes` table on `attribute_id`.  5. **Apply the Conditions:**    - Filter businesses located in Scottsdale by adding a condition `T1.city LIKE 'Scottsdale'`.    - Filter businesses with a high review count by adding a condition `T1.review_count LIKE 'High'`.  6. **Group the Results:**    - Since multiple businesses might have the same attribute, use `GROUP BY T3.attribute_name` to ensure each attribute is listed once.  7. **Write the Complete SQL Query:**    - Combine all the above steps into a coherent SQL query:            SELECT T3.attribute_name      FROM Business AS T1      INNER JOIN Business_Attributes AS T2 ON T1.business_id = T2.business_id      INNER JOIN Attributes AS T3 ON T2.attribute_id = T3.attribute_id      WHERE T1.review_count LIKE 'High'      AND T1.city LIKE 'Scottsdale'      GROUP BY T3.attribute_name;        8. **Verify the Solution:**    - Ensure the query logic aligns with the problem requirements.    - Check that the joins and conditions accurately reflect the relationships and constraints specified.

We need to find businesses that are active and belong to the ""Pets"" category.    - The key tables involved are `Business`, `Business_Categories`, and `Categories`.  2. **Identify the Relationships**:    - The `Business` table contains information about each business, including whether it is active and its star rating.    - The `Business_Categories` table links businesses to their respective categories using `business_id` and `category_id`.    - The `Categories` table provides the names of categories using `category_id` and `category_name`.  3. **Determine the Necessary Joins**:    - To find businesses in the ""Pets"" category, join the `Business_Categories` table with the `Categories` table on `category_id`.    - To filter for active businesses and retrieve their star ratings, join the `Business` table with the `Business_Categories` table on `business_id`.  4. **Filter for Relevant Data**:    - Use a `WHERE` clause to filter businesses that are active. This can be done by checking the `active` column in the `Business` table.    - Further filter the results to include only those businesses that fall under the ""Pets"" category by checking the `category_name` in the `Categories` table.  5. **Select Required Columns**:    - Select the `business_id` and `stars` from the `Business` table to get the desired output.  6. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Combine the above steps into a coherent SQL query:            SELECT T1.business_id, T1.stars       FROM Business AS T1       INNER JOIN Business_Categories ON T1.business_id = Business_Categories.business_id       INNER JOIN Categories AS T3 ON Business_Categories.category_id = T3.category_id       WHERE T1.active LIKE 'TRUE'       AND T3.category_name LIKE 'Pets'        By following these steps, we ensure that we correctly identify and retrieve the active businesses that belong to the ""Pets"" category, along with their star ratings.",,

Here are the logical steps that could have been taken to reach the solution:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to find the category of a business.    - The business must have a short review length and the highest review stars.    - The business ID should be between 5 and 10.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - **Reviews Table**: Contains `review_length` and `review_stars` which are crucial for filtering reviews based on length and sorting by stars.    - **Business Table**: Contains `business_id` which helps in filtering businesses within the specified range.    - **Business_Categories Table**: Links businesses to their categories through `business_id` and `category_id`.    - **Categories Table**: Provides the `category_name` for a given `category_id`.  3. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Start by selecting the `category_name` from the `Categories` table, which is the final output we need.    - Use the `Reviews` table to filter reviews with `review_length` as 'Short'.    - Join the `Reviews` table with the `Business` table on `business_id` to ensure we only consider businesses with IDs between 5 and 10.    - Join the `Business` table with the `Business_Categories` table to link each business to its category.    - Join the `Business_Categories` table with the `Categories` table to get the `category_name`.    - Order the results by `review_stars` in descending order to prioritize businesses with the highest stars.    - Limit the result to 1 to get the top business category with the highest review stars.  4. **Write the SQL Query**:        SELECT T4.category_name     FROM Reviews AS T1     INNER JOIN Business AS T2 ON T1.business_id = T2.business_id     INNER JOIN Business_Categories AS T3 ON T2.business_id = T3.business_id     INNER JOIN Categories AS T4 ON T3.category_id = T4.category_id     WHERE T1.review_length LIKE 'Short'     AND T2.business_id BETWEEN 5 AND 10     ORDER BY T1.review_stars DESC     LIMIT 1;      5. **Verify the Logic**:    - Ensure that the query correctly filters for short reviews.    - Confirm that the business IDs are within the specified range.    - Check that the results are ordered by review stars in descending order.    - Validate that the query returns only one result, which is the category of the business with the highest review stars.

This can be done using a `WHERE` clause on the `city` column in the `Business` table.  5. **Join Tables**:    - To get the opening and closing times for the businesses in Gilbert, we need to join the `Business` and `Business_Hours` tables on the `business_id` column, which is common in both tables.  6. **Sort by Star Rating**:    - Since we need the business with the highest star rating, we should order the results by the `stars` column in descending order.  7. **Limit the Result**:    - To get only the top business with the highest star rating, we use the `LIMIT 1` clause.  8. **Select the Required Columns**:    - Finally, we select the `closing_time` and `opening_time` from the `Business_Hours` table for the business with the highest star rating in Gilbert.  By following these steps, we can construct the SQL query to solve the problem:   SELECT T2.closing_time, T2.opening_time  FROM Business AS T1  INNER JOIN Business_Hours AS T2  ON T1.business_id = T2.business_id  WHERE T1.city LIKE 'Gilbert'  ORDER BY T1.stars DESC  LIMIT 1;   This query effectively retrieves the opening and closing times of the business in Gilbert with the highest star rating by filtering, joining, sorting, and limiting the data appropriately.",,

Here's a structured approach to how one might arrive at the solution:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to list the categories and attributes of businesses that are active, located in Mesa, AZ, and have a low review count.  2. **Analyze the Schema**:    - Identify relevant tables and columns:      - `Business`: Contains information about business activity, location, and review count.      - `Business_Categories`: Links businesses to their categories.      - `Categories`: Provides category names.      - `Business_Attributes`: Links businesses to their attributes.      - `Attributes`: Provides attribute names.  3. **Identify Key Criteria**:    - The businesses must be active (`active = 'true'`).    - They must be located in Mesa, AZ (`city = 'Mesa'` and `state = 'AZ'`).    - They must have a low review count (`review_count = 'Low'`).  4. **Determine the Required Output**:    - We need to output the category names of the businesses meeting the criteria.  5. **Plan the SQL Query**:    - Start with the `Business` table to filter businesses based on activity, location, and review count.    - Use `INNER JOIN` to connect the `Business` table with `Business_Categories` to get category IDs for the filtered businesses.    - Use another `INNER JOIN` to connect `Business_Categories` with `Categories` to get the category names.  6. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Select the category names from the `Categories` table.    - Join `Business` with `Business_Categories` on `business_id`.    - Join `Business_Categories` with `Categories` on `category_id`.    - Apply the filters for active status, location, and review count.  7. **Consider Attributes (if needed)**:    - Although the problem mentions attributes, the provided solution does not include them. If attributes were needed, a similar join process would be used with `Business_Attributes` and `Attributes`.  8. **Write the Final SQL Query**:    - The final query focuses on listing category names as per the problem statement, which matches the provided solution:        SELECT T3.category_name     FROM Business AS T1     INNER JOIN Business_Categories AS T2 ON T1.business_id = T2.business_id     INNER JOIN Categories AS T3 ON T2.category_id = T3.category_id     WHERE T1.review_count = 'Low'     AND T1.city = 'Mesa'     AND T1.active = 'true'     AND T1.state = 'AZ';      By following these logical steps, we ensure that the solution is both comprehensive and aligned with the problem requirements.",,

Here's how you can approach the problem:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to find categories of businesses that are inactive and located in Arizona (AZ).  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**:    - From the schema, the relevant tables are:      - `Business`: Contains information about each business, including whether it is active and its location.      - `Business_Categories`: Links businesses to their categories.      - `Categories`: Provides the names of categories.  3. **Determine Necessary Columns**:    - From the `Business` table, we need:      - `business_id` to identify businesses.      - `active` to check if a business is inactive.      - `state` to filter businesses located in AZ.    - From the `Business_Categories` table, we need:      - `business_id` to link to the `Business` table.      - `category_id` to link to the `Categories` table.    - From the `Categories` table, we need:      - `category_name` to list the names of the categories.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - **Join Tables**: We need to join the `Business`, `Business_Categories`, and `Categories` tables to get the desired information.      - Join `Business` with `Business_Categories` on `business_id` to get the categories linked to each business.      - Join `Business_Categories` with `Categories` on `category_id` to get the category names.    - **Apply Filters**:      - Filter businesses where `active` is `FALSE` to get inactive businesses.      - Filter businesses where `state` is `AZ` to get businesses located in Arizona.  5. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Use the `SELECT` statement to retrieve `category_name`.    - Use `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on the relationships identified.    - Use the `WHERE` clause to apply the necessary filters for inactive businesses in Arizona.  6. **Construct the Final Query**:        SELECT T3.category_name    FROM Business AS T1    INNER JOIN Business_Categories ON T1.business_id = Business_Categories.business_id    INNER JOIN Categories AS T3 ON Business_Categories.category_id = T3.category_id    WHERE T1.active LIKE 'FALSE' AND T1.state LIKE 'AZ';      7. **Verify the Solution**:    - Ensure that the query correctly retrieves the category names for businesses that are inactive and located in Arizona.    - Double-check the logic and ensure that all necessary joins and filters are correctly applied.  By following these steps, you can logically arrive at the solution to the SQL problem.",,

Here are the logical steps to arrive at the solution:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement:**    - We need to extract the opening times of businesses that are active, located in Surprise, and have a low review count.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns:**    - The `Business` table contains information about each business, including whether it is active, its location (city), and review count.    - The `Business_Hours` table provides the opening and closing times for businesses.    - The `Days` table contains information about the days of the week, which might be useful if we need to filter by specific days.  3. **Determine the Necessary Joins:**    - We need to join the `Business` table with the `Business_Hours` table to link each business with its corresponding opening times.    - The `Days` table is included in the schema, but since the problem does not specify filtering by day, it may not be necessary for this query.  4. **Filter the Data:**    - Apply filters to select only those businesses that are located in Surprise, are active, and have a low review count.    - Use conditions in the `WHERE` clause to filter the `Business` table based on the `city`, `active`, and `review_count` columns.  5. **Select the Required Information:**    - After applying the necessary filters, select the `opening_time` from the `Business_Hours` table.  6. **Group the Results:**    - Use `GROUP BY` to ensure that the results are grouped by `opening_time`, which will eliminate duplicates if multiple businesses have the same opening time.  7. **Construct the SQL Query:**    - Combine all the above steps into a coherent SQL query.  Here is the constructed SQL query based on the logical steps:   SELECT T2.opening_time  FROM Business AS T1  INNER JOIN Business_Hours AS T2 ON T1.business_id = T2.business_id  WHERE T1.city LIKE 'Surprise'  AND T1.active LIKE 'TRUE'  AND T1.review_count LIKE 'Low'  GROUP BY T2.opening_time;   This query effectively retrieves the opening times of businesses in Surprise that are active and have a low review count, ensuring that the results are distinct by grouping by `opening_time`.",,

The `CASE` statement assigns a value of 1 if the condition is met (stars < 3), otherwise 0.    - Calculate the total number of businesses in the ""Local Services"" category using `COUNT(T1.stars)`.    - Compute the percentage by dividing the count of businesses with stars < 3 by the total count, then multiply by 100 to convert it to a percentage.  6. **Format the Result**:    - Use `CAST` to ensure the division results in a real number (floating-point) to avoid integer division issues.    - Alias the result as ""percentage"" for clarity.  By following these steps, we can construct the SQL query to solve the problem efficiently. The final query is:   SELECT      CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN T1.stars < 3 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(T1.stars) AS ""percentage"" FROM      Business AS T1 INNER JOIN      Business_Categories ON T1.business_id = Business_Categories.business_id INNER JOIN      Categories AS T3 ON Business_Categories.category_id = T3.category_id WHERE      T3.category_name LIKE 'Local Services'   This query effectively calculates the desired percentage by leveraging table joins and conditional aggregation.",,

Here's a logical breakdown of the steps taken to arrive at the solution:  1. **Understand the Requirements:**    - We need to find businesses in Scottsdale that are active.    - We need to filter these businesses based on their star ratings, specifically those greater than 60% of the average star rating of all active businesses in Scottsdale.    - We need to retrieve the closing time and the corresponding day of the week for these businesses.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns:**    - The `Business` table contains information about the business, including its city, active status, and star rating.    - The `Business_Hours` table contains information about the business hours, including closing time and the day of the week (via `day_id`).    - The `Days` table maps `day_id` to the actual day of the week.  3. **Calculate the Average Star Rating:**    - First, calculate the average star rating of all active businesses in Scottsdale. This involves filtering the `Business` table for entries where `city` is 'Scottsdale' and `active` is true.    - Use the `AVG()` function to compute the average of the `stars` column for these filtered entries.  4. **Filter Businesses Based on Star Rating:**    - Use the calculated average star rating to filter businesses whose star rating is greater than 60% of this average.    - This requires a subquery to calculate the average star rating and compare each business's star rating to 60% of this value.  5. **Join Tables to Retrieve Required Information:**    - Join the `Business` table with the `Business_Hours` table on `business_id` to get the closing time.    - Join the result with the `Days` table on `day_id` to get the corresponding day of the week.  6. **Construct the SQL Query:**    - Use an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Business`, `Business_Hours`, and `Days` tables.    - Apply the necessary filters in the `WHERE` clause to ensure the business is in Scottsdale, is active, and has a star rating greater than 60% of the average.    - Select the `closing_time` and `day_of_week` from the joined tables.  7. **Write the Final SQL Query:**    - The final query should look like this:   SELECT T2.closing_time, T3.day_of_week  FROM Business AS T1  INNER JOIN Business_Hours AS T2 ON T1.business_id = T2.business_id  INNER JOIN Days AS T3 ON T2.day_id = T3.day_id  WHERE T1.city LIKE 'Scottsdale'  AND T1.active LIKE 'TRUE'  AND T1.stars > 0.6 * (     SELECT AVG(T1.stars)      FROM Business AS T1      INNER JOIN Business_Hours AS T2 ON T1.business_id = T2.business_id      INNER JOIN Days AS T3 ON T2.day_id = T3.day_id      WHERE T1.city LIKE 'Scottsdale'      AND T1.active LIKE 'TRUE' );   By following these logical steps, we ensure that the query retrieves the desired information accurately and efficiently.",,

This means we are looking for users who started yelping in 2014 and have zero fans.  2. **Analyze the Schema**: Review the schema to identify which tables and columns are relevant to the problem. The `Users` table seems to be the most relevant as it contains information about users, including when they started yelping and their number of fans.  3. **Identify Relevant Columns**: From the `Users` table, the columns of interest are:    - `user_yelping_since_year`: This column will help us filter users who started yelping in 2014.    - `user_fans`: This column will help us identify users with no followers.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - **Filter Users by Year**: We need to filter users whose `user_yelping_since_year` is 2014.    - **Check for No Followers**: We need to ensure that the `user_fans` column indicates no followers. Based on the schema, `user_fans` with a value of 'None' implies no followers.    - **Count the Users**: Finally, we need to count the number of users who meet both criteria.  5. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Use a `SELECT` statement to count the number of users.    - Use a `WHERE` clause to filter users who started in 2014 and have no followers.  6. **Construct the Final Query**:        SELECT COUNT(user_id)     FROM Users     WHERE user_yelping_since_year = 2014     AND user_fans LIKE 'None';      7. **Verify the Solution**: Ensure that the query logic aligns with the problem requirements and that the schema supports the conditions used in the query.

Here’s a step-by-step logical approach to arrive at the solution:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to find users who have received less than 5 low compliments.    - The result should include at least 5 users.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - The `Users_Compliments` table is relevant because it contains information about compliments received by users.    - Specifically, the columns `user_id` and `number_of_compliments` are of interest. The `number_of_compliments` column indicates the type of compliments received.  3. **Filter Compliments**:    - We need to focus on compliments that are categorized as 'Low'. This means we should filter rows in the `Users_Compliments` table where `number_of_compliments` is 'Low'.  4. **Aggregate Compliments by User**:    - We need to count the number of 'Low' compliments each user has received. This can be done using a `GROUP BY` clause on `user_id` and using an aggregate function like `COUNT()` to count the occurrences of 'Low' compliments.  5. **Apply the Condition**:    - We are interested in users who have received less than 5 'Low' compliments. This means we need to filter the aggregated results to include only those with a count of 'Low' compliments that is less than 5.  6. **Select and Limit the Results**:    - Finally, we need to select the `user_id` of these users.    - Since the problem specifies listing at least 5 users, we should use a `LIMIT` clause to ensure we return at least 5 results.  7. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Based on the above steps, the SQL query can be constructed as follows:            SELECT user_id       FROM Users_Compliments       WHERE number_of_compliments LIKE 'Low'       GROUP BY user_id       HAVING COUNT(number_of_compliments) < 5       LIMIT 5;        8. **Verify and Test the Query**:    - Ensure the query logic aligns with the problem requirements.    - Test the query on the database to confirm it returns the expected results.  By following these logical steps, we can systematically arrive at the solution to the problem, ensuring that all conditions are met and the query is optimized for the desired output.",,

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logical reasoning process to arrive at the solution:  1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to find businesses that are open from 10 AM to 12 PM on Sundays and identify the cities where these businesses are located.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**:    - **Business**: Contains information about businesses, including their city.    - **Business_Hours**: Contains information about the operating hours of businesses.    - **Days**: Contains information about the days of the week.  3. **Determine Necessary Joins**:    - We need to join the `Business` table with the `Business_Hours` table to link business IDs with their operating hours.    - We also need to join the `Business_Hours` table with the `Days` table to filter by the specific day of the week (Sunday).  4. **Formulate the Conditions**:    - We need to filter businesses that are open from 10 AM to 12 PM. This requires checking the `opening_time` and `closing_time` columns in the `Business_Hours` table.    - We need to ensure that the day is Sunday, which involves checking the `day_of_week` column in the `Days` table.  5. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Start by selecting the `city` from the `Business` table.    - Use an INNER JOIN to connect the `Business` table with the `Business_Hours` table on `business_id`.    - Use another INNER JOIN to connect the `Business_Hours` table with the `Days` table on `day_id`.    - Apply the WHERE clause to filter for `opening_time` as '10AM', `closing_time` as '12PM', and `day_of_week` as 'Sunday'.  6. **Construct the Final Query**:        SELECT T1.city     FROM Business AS T1     INNER JOIN Business_Hours AS T2 ON T1.business_id = T2.business_id     INNER JOIN Days AS T3 ON T2.day_id = T3.day_id     WHERE T2.opening_time LIKE '10AM'       AND T2.closing_time LIKE '12PM'       AND T3.day_of_week LIKE 'Sunday';      7. **Verify the Solution**:    - Ensure that the query correctly joins the tables and applies the necessary filters.    - Check that the selected `city` corresponds to businesses meeting the specified conditions.  By following these steps, we logically deduce the necessary SQL query to solve the problem.",,

Here is a structured approach to arrive at the solution:  1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to find out how many businesses are open 24 hours. This implies that there is some attribute or indicator in the database that specifies whether a business is open 24 hours.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:     - Review the schema to identify tables that might contain information about business attributes. The `Attributes` table and the `Business_Attributes` table seem relevant because they likely store information about business characteristics.    - The `Attributes` table contains `attribute_name`, which could include ""Open 24 Hours"".    - The `Business_Attributes` table links attributes to specific businesses through `business_id` and `attribute_value`.  3. **Determine the Relationship Between Tables**:    - The `Attributes` table has an `attribute_id` that can be linked to the `Business_Attributes` table's `attribute_id`. This relationship allows us to connect specific attributes to businesses.  4. **Formulate the Query**:    - We need to filter businesses that have the attribute ""Open 24 Hours"". This can be done by joining the `Attributes` table with the `Business_Attributes` table on `attribute_id`.    - Use a `WHERE` clause to filter for `attribute_name` that matches ""Open 24 Hours"" and `attribute_value` that indicates the business is open (assuming ""TRUE"" is the indicator for being open 24 hours).  5. **Count the Number of Businesses**:    - Use the `COUNT` function to count the number of distinct `business_id`s that meet the criteria. This will give us the total number of businesses open 24 hours.  6. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Based on the above logic, the SQL query would be:            SELECT COUNT(T2.business_id)      FROM Attributes AS T1      INNER JOIN Business_Attributes AS T2 ON T1.attribute_id = T2.attribute_id      WHERE T2.attribute_value LIKE 'TRUE' AND T1.attribute_name LIKE 'Open 24 Hours'        7. **Verify and Validate**:    - Ensure that the query correctly joins the tables and filters the data as intended.    - Validate the results against any known data or additional checks to confirm accuracy.  By following these steps, we systematically arrive at the solution to determine how many businesses are open for 24 hours using the provided schema and understanding of the problem.",,

Here's how you might approach the problem:  1. **Understand the Requirements**:     - We need to find businesses that have specific attributes: ""Good for Groups"" and ""Good for Dancing"".    - The businesses must be active.    - We need at least 5 business IDs.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - The `Attributes` table contains attribute names like ""Good for Groups"" and ""Good for Dancing"".    - The `Business_Attributes` table links businesses to their attributes via `attribute_id`.    - The `Business` table contains the `active` status of businesses.  3. **Determine the Relationships**:    - The `Attributes` table is related to the `Business_Attributes` table through `attribute_id`.    - The `Business_Attributes` table is related to the `Business` table through `business_id`.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - **Join Tables**: Use INNER JOIN to connect `Attributes`, `Business_Attributes`, and `Business` tables.      - Join `Attributes` and `Business_Attributes` on `attribute_id`.      - Join `Business_Attributes` and `Business` on `business_id`.    - **Filter Conditions**:      - Ensure the `attribute_value` is 'TRUE' for both ""Good for Groups"" and ""Good for Dancing"".      - Ensure the business is active (`active = true`).    - **Select and Limit**:      - Select `business_id` and limit the results to 5.  5. **Write the SQL Query**:    - The query should look like this:            SELECT T2.business_id       FROM Attributes AS T1       INNER JOIN Business_Attributes AS T2 ON T1.attribute_id = T2.attribute_id       INNER JOIN Business AS T3 ON T2.business_id = T3.business_id       WHERE T2.attribute_value LIKE 'TRUE'         AND T1.attribute_name LIKE 'Good for Dancing'         AND T1.attribute_name LIKE 'Good for Groups'         AND T3.active = true       LIMIT 5;        6. **Review and Test**:    - Ensure that the query logic aligns with the problem requirements.    - Test the query to verify it returns the correct results.

This requires joining with the `Business_Hours` and `Days` tables to check if there is an entry for Sunday.  4. **Plan the SQL Query**:    - Start by selecting the `business_id` from the `Business` table.    - Join the `Business` table with the `Business_Hours` table on `business_id` to get the business hours.    - Join the resulting table with the `Days` table on `day_id` to map the day of the week.    - Apply the conditions for city, active status, and day of the week.  5. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Use an INNER JOIN to combine the `Business`, `Business_Hours`, and `Days` tables.    - Use a WHERE clause to filter businesses based on the city (`Ahwatukee`), active status (`TRUE`), and day of the week (`Sunday`).  6. **Verify the Query**:    - Ensure that the query correctly selects businesses that meet all the specified conditions.    - Check that the joins are correctly linking the tables based on the appropriate keys (`business_id` and `day_id`).  By following these steps, we arrive at the SQL solution:   SELECT T1.business_id  FROM Business AS T1  INNER JOIN Business_Hours AS T2 ON T1.business_id = T2.business_id  INNER JOIN Days AS T3 ON T2.day_id = T3.day_id  WHERE T1.city LIKE 'Ahwatukee'  AND T1.active LIKE 'TRUE'  AND T3.day_of_week LIKE 'Sunday'   This query effectively identifies all active businesses in Ahwatukee that are open on Sunday.",,

This can be done by checking the `active` column in the `Business` table.    - Further filter the results to exclude businesses located in Arizona by checking the `state` column in the `Business` table.  5. **Select the Required Columns**:    - After filtering, select the `category_name` from the `Categories` table.  6. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Combine the above steps into a SQL query:            SELECT T3.category_name       FROM Business AS T1       INNER JOIN Business_Categories ON T1.business_id = Business_Categories.business_id       INNER JOIN Categories AS T3 ON Business_Categories.category_id = T3.category_id       WHERE T1.active LIKE 'TRUE' AND T1.state NOT LIKE 'AZ'        7. **Verify the Solution**:    - Ensure the query logic aligns with the problem requirements.    - Check that the query correctly joins the tables and applies the necessary filters.

By following these steps, you can logically deduce the solution to the SQL problem and construct the appropriate query.",,

This means `opening_time` should be '12AM' and `closing_time` should be '1AM'.    - Filter for entries where the `day_of_week` is 'Saturday'.  6. **Select the Desired Output**:    - Once the relevant businesses are identified, select the `city` from the `Business` table.  7. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Combine all the above steps into a coherent SQL query:            SELECT T1.city       FROM Business AS T1       INNER JOIN Business_Hours AS T2 ON T1.business_id = T2.business_id       INNER JOIN Days AS T3 ON T2.day_id = T3.day_id       WHERE T2.closing_time = '1AM'         AND T2.opening_time = '12AM'         AND T3.day_of_week = 'Saturday';        By following these steps, we can logically arrive at the solution to the problem, ensuring that all necessary conditions are met to identify the correct city.",,

This implies that there is an attribute related to businesses that indicates whether they accept insurance or not.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**: From the schema provided, the relevant tables are likely to be `Attributes` and `Business_Attributes`. The `Attributes` table contains various attributes that businesses might have, and the `Business_Attributes` table links these attributes to specific businesses.  3. **Locate the Attribute for Insurance**: In the `Attributes` table, we need to find the attribute that corresponds to ""Accepts Insurance"". This involves checking the `attribute_name` column for the value ""Accepts Insurance"".  4. **Join Tables to Link Attributes with Businesses**: We need to join the `Business_Attributes` table with the `Attributes` table to filter out businesses that have the ""Accepts Insurance"" attribute. This can be achieved by joining on the `attribute_id` column, which is common to both tables.  5. **Filter for Businesses Accepting Insurance**: Once the tables are joined, we need to filter the results to include only those entries where the `attribute_value` is 'true', indicating that the business does indeed accept insurance.  6. **Count the Number of Businesses**: After filtering the businesses that accept insurance, the final step is to count the number of unique `business_id`s that meet the criteria.  7. **Formulate the SQL Query**: Combine all these steps into a single SQL query:        SELECT COUNT(T1.business_id)    FROM Business_Attributes AS T1    INNER JOIN Attributes AS T2 ON T1.attribute_id = T2.attribute_id    WHERE T2.attribute_name = 'Accepts Insurance' AND T1.attribute_value = 'true';      By following these steps, we can systematically approach the problem and derive the solution to find out how many businesses accept insurance.",,

Here’s how you can approach the solution:  1. **Understand the Schema**: Familiarize yourself with the tables and their relationships. The key tables involved are `Business` and `Reviews`. The `Business` table contains information about the location of businesses, and the `Reviews` table contains user reviews and their star ratings.  2. **Identify Relevant Data**: We need to focus on businesses located in South Carolina (SC) and California (CA). This information is stored in the `state` column of the `Business` table.  3. **Join Tables**: To get the review stars for businesses in SC and CA, we need to join the `Business` table with the `Reviews` table on the `business_id` column. This will allow us to access both the location of the business and the review stars.  4. **Filter by State**: After joining the tables, filter the results to include only those businesses located in SC and CA. This can be done using a `WHERE` clause that checks the `state` column for 'SC' or 'CA'.  5. **Calculate Sum of Stars**: For each state, calculate the sum of the `review_stars` from the `Reviews` table for businesses in that state. This involves using the `SUM()` function.  6. **Calculate Total Sum of Stars**: To find the average, we need the total sum of stars for all reviews. This involves calculating the sum of `review_stars` for all businesses, regardless of state.  7. **Compute Average**: The average review star for businesses in SC and CA is calculated by dividing the sum of review stars for SC and CA by the total sum of review stars for all businesses. This gives us a weighted average based on the total reviews.  8. **Handle Division**: Ensure that the division operation is handled correctly to avoid integer division. This can be done by multiplying the numerator by 1.0 to ensure floating-point division.  9. **Formulate the SQL Query**: Combine all the above steps into a single SQL query. Use subqueries to calculate the sum of stars for SC and CA separately, and then combine these results to compute the average.  Here is the SQL query based on these steps:   SELECT 1.0 * (     (SELECT SUM(T2.review_stars)      FROM Business AS T1      INNER JOIN Reviews AS T2 ON T1.business_id = T2.business_id      WHERE T1.state = 'SC') +     (SELECT SUM(T2.review_stars)      FROM Business AS T1      INNER JOIN Reviews AS T2 ON T1.business_id = T2.business_id      WHERE T1.state = 'CA') ) / (     SELECT SUM(T2.review_stars)     FROM Business AS T1     INNER JOIN Reviews AS T2 ON T1.business_id = T2.business_id ) AS result;   By following these logical steps, you can systematically approach the problem and arrive at the correct solution.",,

In this case, the `Business`, `Business_Hours`, and `Days` tables are relevant.    - The `Business` table contains business identifiers.    - The `Business_Hours` table contains information about the business hours for each day.    - The `Days` table maps day IDs to the actual day names.  2. **Identify the Required Data**:    - We need to find businesses that are open on Monday and Tuesday between 10 am and 9 pm.    - Specifically, we need to filter businesses based on their opening and closing times.  3. **Join the Tables**:    - Use an INNER JOIN to combine the `Business` and `Business_Hours` tables on the `business_id` column to get the hours for each business.    - Join the `Business_Hours` table with the `Days` table on the `day_id` column to get the actual day names.  4. **Filter the Data**:    - Apply a WHERE clause to filter records where the `opening_time` is '10AM' and the `closing_time` is '9PM'.  5. **Calculate the Difference**:    - Use a CASE statement within a SUM function to count the number of businesses open on Monday and Tuesday.    - For each row, add 1 to the count if the day is Monday, and subtract 1 if the day is Tuesday.  6. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Construct the SQL query to implement the above logic:            SELECT           SUM(CASE WHEN T3.day_of_week = 'Monday' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) -           SUM(CASE WHEN T3.day_of_week = 'Tuesday' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS DIFF      FROM           Business AS T1      INNER JOIN           Business_Hours AS T2 ON T1.business_id = T2.business_id      INNER JOIN           Days AS T3 ON T2.day_id = T3.day_id      WHERE           T2.opening_time = '10AM' AND T2.closing_time = '9PM';        7. **Verify the Solution**:    - Review the query to ensure it accurately reflects the problem requirements.    - Consider edge cases, such as businesses that may not have hours listed for both days.  By following these steps, we can logically derive the solution to the problem of finding the difference in the number of businesses open on Monday and Tuesday during the specified hours.",,

This requires identifying the correct table and column where this information is stored.  2. **Review the Schema**: Examine the provided schema to identify which table contains information about attributes. The table named `Attributes` seems to be the most relevant because it contains columns `attribute_id` and `attribute_name`.  3. **Identify Relevant Columns**: In the `Attributes` table, the `attribute_name` column contains the names of various attributes, and the `attribute_id` column contains their corresponding ID numbers.  4. **Formulate the Query**: To find the ID for ""Accepts Insurance,"" you need to filter the `Attributes` table to find the row where `attribute_name` is ""Accepts Insurance"" and then select the `attribute_id` for that row.  5. **Write the SQL Query**: Construct the SQL query to retrieve the desired information:        SELECT attribute_id FROM Attributes WHERE attribute_name = 'Accepts Insurance';        - This query selects the `attribute_id` from the `Attributes` table where the `attribute_name` matches ""Accepts Insurance.""  6. **Verify the Solution**: Ensure that the query correctly identifies the attribute ID by checking the structure and data of the `Attributes` table.

We need to find the business with the highest review count.    - Since the schema provides sample values like 'Low', 'Medium', and 'Uber' for `review_count`, we assume 'Uber' represents the highest review count.  5. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Use an SQL query to select the `business_id` from the `Business` table where the business is active, located in ""Gilbert"", and has a review count of 'Uber'.    - The query should ensure that only distinct business IDs are returned, in case there are multiple entries for the same business.  6. **Construct the SQL Query**:        SELECT DISTINCT T1.business_id     FROM Business AS T1     WHERE T1.active = 'true'       AND T1.city = 'Gilbert'       AND T1.review_count = 'Uber'      7. **Verify the Solution**:    - Ensure that the query correctly identifies businesses that meet all the specified criteria.    - Confirm that the use of `DISTINCT` is appropriate to avoid duplicate business IDs in the result.

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to find out how many ""long"" reviews a business in ""Tempe"" city with ""3.5"" stars and a review count labeled as ""Uber"" has received.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**:    - The problem involves businesses and their reviews. Therefore, the relevant tables are `Business` and `Reviews`.  3. **Determine the Necessary Columns**:    - From the `Business` table, we need:      - `city` to filter businesses located in ""Tempe"".      - `stars` to filter businesses with ""3.5"" stars.      - `review_count` to filter businesses with a review count labeled as ""Uber"".    - From the `Reviews` table, we need:      - `review_length` to count the number of ""long"" reviews.  4. **Establish Table Relationships**:    - The `Business` table is related to the `Reviews` table through the `business_id` column. This relationship allows us to join these tables and filter reviews based on business attributes.  5. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Start with a `SELECT` statement to count the number of ""long"" reviews.    - Use an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Business` and `Reviews` tables on the `business_id` column.    - Apply `WHERE` clauses to filter:      - Businesses located in ""Tempe"".      - Businesses with ""3.5"" stars.      - Businesses with a review count labeled as ""Uber"".      - Reviews with a `review_length` of ""Long"".  6. **Write the SQL Query**:    - The final SQL query is:            SELECT COUNT(T2.review_length)      FROM Business AS T1      INNER JOIN Reviews AS T2 ON T1.business_id = T2.business_id      WHERE T1.city = 'Tempe'        AND T1.stars = '3.5'        AND T1.review_count = 'Uber'        AND T2.review_length = 'Long';        7. **Verify the Query**:    - Ensure the query logic matches the problem requirements and that all necessary conditions are included.  By following these logical steps, we can systematically approach the problem, identify the necessary data, and construct an appropriate SQL query to find the desired result.",,

Here are the logical steps that could have been taken to reach the solution:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: We need to find the ""noise level"" for a business located in ""Mesa"" with an ""Uber"" review count. The ""noise level"" is an attribute of a business.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**:     - The `Business` table contains information about businesses, including their city and review count.    - The `Business_Attributes` table links businesses to their attributes.    - The `Attributes` table contains the names of the attributes, including ""Noise Level"".  3. **Establish Relationships Between Tables**:    - The `Business` table can be linked to the `Business_Attributes` table using the `business_id`.    - The `Business_Attributes` table can be linked to the `Attributes` table using the `attribute_id`.  4. **Filter Businesses by City and Review Count**:    - Start by filtering the `Business` table to find businesses located in ""Mesa"" with a review count of ""Uber"".  5. **Join Tables to Access Attributes**:    - Perform an INNER JOIN between the `Business` table and the `Business_Attributes` table to get the attributes associated with the filtered businesses.    - Perform another INNER JOIN between the `Business_Attributes` table and the `Attributes` table to get the attribute names.  6. **Filter for ""Noise Level"" Attribute**:    - Since we are specifically interested in the ""Noise Level"" attribute, add a condition to filter the results to only include rows where the `attribute_name` is ""Noise Level"".  7. **Select the Desired Attribute Name**:    - Finally, select the `attribute_name` from the results, which should be ""Noise Level"" for the business that meets the criteria.  8. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Combine all the above steps into a SQL query:            SELECT T3.attribute_name      FROM Business AS T1      INNER JOIN Business_Attributes AS T2 ON T1.business_id = T2.business_id      INNER JOIN Attributes AS T3 ON T2.attribute_id = T3.attribute_id      WHERE T1.city = 'Mesa'      AND T1.review_count = 'Uber'      AND T3.attribute_name = 'Noise Level';        By following these logical steps, we can effectively query the database to find the ""noise level"" attribute for the specified business.",,

Here’s how we can approach the problem:  1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to determine if a specific business (business_id = 14033) is suitable for supper. This typically involves checking if the business has attributes indicating it is good for dinner.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**: From the schema, the tables that seem relevant to this problem are:    - `Attributes`: Contains the different types of attributes a business can have.    - `Business_Attributes`: Links businesses to their specific attributes.  3. **Determine the Necessary Information**: We need to find out if the business has an attribute that indicates it is good for dinner. This means we need to look for an attribute with a name like ""good_for_dinner"" or similar.  4. **Formulate the Query**:    - **Join Tables**: We need to join the `Business_Attributes` table with the `Attributes` table to get the attribute names for each business.    - **Filter by Attribute Name**: We filter the results to only include rows where the attribute name is ""good_for_dinner"".    - **Filter by Business ID**: We also filter to only include the business with ID 14033.  5. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Start by selecting the `attribute_value` from the `Business_Attributes` table.    - Use an INNER JOIN to connect `Business_Attributes` with `Attributes` on `attribute_id`.    - Add a WHERE clause to filter for `attribute_name = 'good_for_dinner'`.    - Add another condition in the WHERE clause to filter for `business_id = 14033`.  6. **Execute and Interpret the Query**: Run the query to retrieve the `attribute_value` for the specified business and attribute. The result will indicate whether the business is considered good for supper based on its attributes.  By following these logical steps, we can systematically determine if business No. 14033 is suitable for supper. The final SQL query is:   SELECT T1.attribute_value  FROM Business_Attributes AS T1  INNER JOIN Attributes AS T2  ON T1.attribute_id = T2.attribute_id  WHERE T2.attribute_name = 'good_for_dinner'  AND T1.business_id = 14033;   This query will return the attribute value that indicates whether the business is good for dinner, helping us answer the original question.",,

By following these steps, we can construct a query that accurately determines the duration for which the business is open on Monday. The final SQL query is:   SELECT SUBSTR(T1.closing_time, 1, 2) + 12 - SUBSTR(T1.opening_time, 1, 2) AS YYSJ FROM Business_Hours AS T1 INNER JOIN Days AS T2 ON T1.day_id = T2.day_id WHERE T2.day_of_week = 'Monday' AND T1.business_id = 15098;",,

Here's a breakdown of the thought process:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to find the business ID of a Yelp business located in ""Phoenix"" that received a ""5"" star review with an ""uber"" number of votes for funny.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - We need information about businesses, their locations, reviews, and the votes on those reviews.    - Relevant tables: `Business`, `Reviews`.    - Relevant columns:      - From `Business`: `business_id`, `city`.      - From `Reviews`: `business_id`, `review_stars`, `review_votes_funny`.  3. **Determine the Relationships Between Tables**:    - The `Business` table and `Reviews` table are related through the `business_id` column, which is common to both tables.  4. **Filter Businesses by Location**:    - We need businesses located in ""Phoenix"". This can be filtered using the `city` column in the `Business` table.  5. **Filter Reviews by Star Rating and Funny Votes**:    - We are interested in reviews with a ""5"" star rating and ""uber"" votes for funny. This requires filtering the `Reviews` table using `review_stars = 5` and `review_votes_funny = 'Uber'`.  6. **Join Tables to Combine Information**:    - Since we need to combine information from both the `Business` and `Reviews` tables, we perform an INNER JOIN on the `business_id` column.  7. **Select the Required Output**:    - Finally, we need to select the `business_id` from the combined result that meets all the specified conditions.  8. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Combine all the above steps into a single SQL query:            SELECT T1.business_id       FROM Business AS T1       INNER JOIN Reviews AS T2       ON T1.business_id = T2.business_id       WHERE T1.city = 'Phoenix'       AND T2.review_stars = 5       AND T2.review_votes_funny = 'Uber';        By following these logical steps, we ensure that the query accurately retrieves the business ID of the desired Yelp business based on the given criteria.",,

This allows us to join these tables.  5. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - We need to join the `Business` and `Tips` tables on `business_id` to combine the relevant data.    - We need to filter the results to include only those entries where the `tip_length` is ""Medium"" and `likes` is 3.  6. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Use an INNER JOIN to combine the `Business` and `Tips` tables on the `business_id`.    - Apply a WHERE clause to filter for `tip_length = 'Medium'` and `likes = 3`.    - Select the `city` from the `Business` table as the final output.  7. **SQL Query**:        SELECT T1.city    FROM Business AS T1    INNER JOIN Tips AS T2 ON T1.business_id = T2.business_id    WHERE T2.tip_length = 'Medium' AND T2.likes = 3;      8. **Verify the Query**:    - Ensure that the query correctly joins the tables and applies the filters.    - Check if the output meets the problem requirements.

Here's how you might approach the problem:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to find out how many compliments of type ""cool"" are received by a specific user, identified by user_id 41717.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**:    - From the schema, identify which tables contain information about compliments and user associations. The relevant tables are:      - `Compliments`: Contains `compliment_id` and `compliment_type`.      - `Users_Compliments`: Contains `compliment_id`, `user_id`, and `number_of_compliments`.  3. **Determine the Relationship Between Tables**:    - The `Compliments` table provides the type of each compliment, and the `Users_Compliments` table associates these compliments with users.    - The common column between these tables is `compliment_id`, which allows us to join them.  4. **Filter for Specific Conditions**:    - We need to filter compliments to only those of type ""cool"". This can be done by using a `WHERE` clause on the `compliment_type` column in the `Compliments` table.    - Additionally, we need to filter for the specific user, user_id 41717, using a `WHERE` clause on the `user_id` column in the `Users_Compliments` table.  5. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Use an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Compliments` and `Users_Compliments` tables on `compliment_id`.    - Apply the necessary filters to select only ""cool"" compliments for user_id 41717.    - Use `COUNT()` to aggregate the number of such compliments.  6. **Write the SQL Query**:    - The SQL query is constructed as follows:            SELECT COUNT(T2.number_of_compliments)      FROM Compliments AS T1      INNER JOIN Users_Compliments AS T2 ON T1.compliment_id = T2.compliment_id      WHERE T1.compliment_type = 'cool' AND T2.user_id = 41717;        7. **Verify the Query**:    - Ensure that the query correctly counts the number of ""cool"" compliments for the specified user by checking the logic and the join conditions.

We need to check the attributes associated with this business.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**: Based on the schema provided, the tables relevant to solving this problem are:    - `Attributes`: This table contains the list of all possible attributes (e.g., ""parking lot"").    - `Business_Attributes`: This table links businesses to their specific attributes and their values.  3. **Determine Necessary Joins**: To find out if business No. ""11825"" has a ""parking lot,"" we need to:    - Join the `Business_Attributes` table with the `Attributes` table. This will allow us to match the attribute names with their corresponding values for the specific business.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - **Select the Attribute Value**: We need to select the `attribute_value` from the `Business_Attributes` table, which will tell us if the business has a ""parking lot.""    - **Join the Tables**: Use an INNER JOIN to combine `Business_Attributes` and `Attributes` on the `attribute_id`. This ensures that we can filter by attribute name.    - **Apply Filters**:      - Filter by `business_id = 11825` to focus on the specific business in question.      - Filter by `attribute_name = 'parking_lot'` to check for the presence of a parking lot attribute.  5. **Construct the SQL Query**: Based on the above steps, the SQL query is constructed as follows:        SELECT T1.attribute_value     FROM Business_Attributes AS T1     INNER JOIN Attributes AS T2     ON T1.attribute_id = T2.attribute_id     WHERE T1.business_id = 11825     AND T2.attribute_name = 'parking_lot';      6. **Interpret the Results**: Execute the query. If the result returns a non-null value, it indicates that the business has a ""parking lot."" If no rows are returned or the value is null, the business does not have a ""parking lot.""  By following these logical steps, we can effectively determine whether the specified business has a ""parking lot"" as an attribute.",,

Here's how you could approach solving the problem:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: The goal is to find out if a specific business (ID 12476) accepts Mastercard as a payment method. This requires checking the business's attributes related to payment types.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**: From the schema, the relevant tables are:    - `Business_Attributes`: Contains information about various attributes associated with businesses, including payment methods.    - `Attributes`: Contains the names of attributes, which may include payment types.  3. **Determine Required Information**: We need to find an attribute related to Mastercard payment. Specifically, we are looking for an attribute name that indicates Mastercard is accepted.  4. **Formulate a Query Plan**:    - **Join Tables**: We need to join `Business_Attributes` and `Attributes` tables. The join should be on the `attribute_id` since this is the common column between these two tables.    - **Filter by Business ID**: We need to filter the results to only include records where `business_id` is 12476.    - **Filter by Attribute Name**: We need to filter the results to only include records where the `attribute_name` is related to Mastercard payment. We assume that the attribute name is something like 'payment_types_mastercard'.  5. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Use an INNER JOIN to combine `Business_Attributes` and `Attributes` on `attribute_id`.    - Apply WHERE conditions to filter by `business_id` = 12476 and `attribute_name` = 'payment_types_mastercard'.    - Select the `attribute_value` to determine if Mastercard is accepted.  6. **Execute and Interpret Results**: The query will return the `attribute_value` for the specified business and attribute. If the result indicates a positive value (e.g., 'yes', 'true'), then Mastercard payment is possible. If it returns a negative or null value, Mastercard payment is not possible.  By following these logical steps, you can systematically determine whether the business accepts Mastercard payments. The solution query is:   SELECT T1.attribute_value  FROM Business_Attributes AS T1  INNER JOIN Attributes AS T2  ON T1.attribute_id = T2.attribute_id  WHERE T1.business_id = 12476  AND T2.attribute_name = 'payment_types_mastercard';",,

Identify that the `Business_Categories` table links businesses to categories through `business_id` and `category_id`. The `Categories` table provides the `category_name` for each `category_id`.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**: Determine which tables are necessary for solving the problem. In this case, the `Business_Categories` and `Categories` tables are relevant because they contain information about business categories.  3. **Determine the Required Data**: We need to calculate the percentage of businesses in the ""Pets"" category. This requires:    - Counting the total number of businesses.    - Counting the number of businesses in the ""Pets"" category.  4. **Join Tables**: Use an INNER JOIN to combine `Business_Categories` and `Categories` tables. This allows us to access the `category_name` for each business through the `category_id`.  5. **Filter for ""Pets"" Category**: Use a CASE statement to create a conditional count. For each row, check if the `category_name` is ""Pets"". If true, count it as 1; otherwise, count it as 0.  6. **Calculate Total Businesses**: Use the COUNT function to determine the total number of businesses by counting all entries in the `category_name` column after the join.  7. **Calculate Percentage**: Divide the count of ""Pets"" businesses by the total number of businesses. Multiply by 100 to convert this ratio into a percentage.  8. **Cast for Precision**: Ensure the division result is a real number to avoid integer division issues. Use the CAST function to convert the numerator to a REAL type before performing the division.  9. **Write the SQL Query**: Combine all the above steps into a single SQL query:        SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN T2.category_name = 'Pets' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(T2.category_name)    FROM Business_Categories AS T1    INNER JOIN Categories AS T2 ON T1.category_id = T2.category_id;      By following these steps, we logically derive the solution to calculate the percentage of businesses in the ""Pets"" category.",,

The `Business` table is relevant here, as it contains columns such as `business_id` and `active`.  3. **Determine the Condition for Running Businesses**: A business is considered running if the `active` column is set to `'true'`. We need to count how many businesses meet this condition.  4. **Calculate Total Number of Businesses**: To find the percentage, we also need to know the total number of businesses. This can be obtained by counting all entries in the `Business` table using the `business_id` column.  5. **Count Active Businesses**: Use a conditional count to determine how many businesses have `active = 'true'`. This can be achieved using a `CASE` statement within a `SUM` function to count entries where the condition is met.  6. **Calculate the Percentage**: The percentage of running businesses is calculated by dividing the count of active businesses by the total number of businesses and then multiplying by 100 to convert it into a percentage.  7. **Construct the SQL Query**: Combine the above logic into a single SQL query. Use `SUM` with a `CASE` statement to count active businesses, and `COUNT` to get the total number of businesses. Finally, compute the percentage.  8. **Ensure Correct Data Type**: To ensure accurate division and percentage calculation, cast the numerator to a `REAL` type before performing the division.  9. **Write the Final SQL Query**:        SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN active = 'true' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(business_id) FROM Business      By following these steps, we systematically break down the problem and construct a query that calculates the desired percentage of running businesses.",,

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - The task is to list down the `attribute_id` and `attribute_name` from the `Attributes` table where the `attribute_name` starts with the string ""music"".  2. **Identify the Relevant Table**:    - From the provided schema, identify which table contains the `attribute_id` and `attribute_name` columns. In this case, it is the `Attributes` table.  3. **Determine the Filtering Condition**:    - We need to filter the records based on the `attribute_name` starting with ""music"". This requires using a string matching condition.  4. **Choose the Appropriate SQL Clause**:    - To filter strings based on a starting pattern, the `LIKE` clause is suitable. The pattern ""music%"" will match any `attribute_name` that begins with ""music"".  5. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Start by selecting the required columns: `attribute_id` and `attribute_name`.    - Apply the `WHERE` clause with the `LIKE` condition to filter the results.    - The resulting SQL query is:             SELECT attribute_id, attribute_name       FROM Attributes       WHERE attribute_name LIKE 'music%'        6. **Review and Validate**:    - Ensure that the query accurately reflects the problem requirements.    - Confirm that the `LIKE 'music%'` condition will correctly identify all attribute names starting with ""music"".  By following these logical steps, we arrive at a solution that efficiently retrieves the desired data from the `Attributes` table.",,

The `Elite` table is of interest because it contains information about elite users and the years they were considered elite.    - The relevant columns in the `Elite` table are `user_id` and `year_id`.  3. **Filter the Relevant Data:**    - We are only interested in the years 2006 and 2007. Therefore, we need to filter the `Elite` table to include only records where `year_id` is either 2006 or 2007.  4. **Count the Number of Elite Users for Each Year:**    - For each year (2006 and 2007), count the number of unique `user_id` entries. This will give us the number of elite users for each year.  5. **Compare the Counts:**    - We need to determine which year had a greater count of elite users. This can be achieved by grouping the results by `year_id` and ordering them by the count of `user_id` in descending order.  6. **Select the Year with the Maximum Count:**    - After ordering the results, the year with the highest count will be at the top. We can limit the result to 1 to get the year with the maximum number of elite users.  7. **Formulate the SQL Query:**    - Based on the above steps, the SQL query should filter the `Elite` table for the years 2006 and 2007, group by `year_id`, order by the count of `user_id` in descending order, and limit the result to 1.  Here's the SQL query that implements these steps:   SELECT year_id  FROM Elite  WHERE year_id IN (2006, 2007)  GROUP BY year_id  ORDER BY COUNT(user_id) DESC  LIMIT 1;   This query effectively answers the problem by identifying which year, between 2006 and 2007, had the greater number of elite users.",,

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logical reasoning that leads to the solution:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to calculate the percentage of ""Low"" compliments out of all compliments for each `compliment_id`.  2. **Identify Relevant Table and Columns**:    - The `Users_Compliments` table is relevant because it contains information about user compliments.    - The columns of interest are `number_of_compliments` (which indicates if a compliment is ""Low"") and `user_id` (to count total compliments).  3. **Determine the Calculation Needed**:    - We need the number of ""Low"" compliments and the total number of compliments to calculate the percentage.    - The formula for percentage is: (Number of ""Low"" Compliments / Total Number of Compliments) * 100.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Use a `CASE` statement to count the number of ""Low"" compliments.    - Use `SUM` to aggregate the count of ""Low"" compliments.    - Use `COUNT` to get the total number of compliments (using `user_id` as each row represents a compliment).    - Calculate the percentage by dividing the count of ""Low"" compliments by the total count and multiplying by 100.  5. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Use `CAST` to ensure the division results in a real number (floating-point division) rather than integer division.    - The query is constructed as follows:            SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN number_of_compliments = 'Low' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(user_id)       FROM Users_compliments        6. **Verify the Logic**:    - Ensure the `CASE` statement correctly identifies ""Low"" compliments.    - Confirm that `COUNT(user_id)` accurately represents the total number of compliments.    - Check that the calculation correctly computes the percentage as intended.  By following these logical steps, we arrive at a solution that accurately calculates the required percentage of ""Low"" compliments.",,

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logical reasoning process:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement:**    - We need to find users who started using Yelp in 2004 and have a high number of followers.    - For these users, we need to retrieve their user ID, the business ID they have tipped, and the length of their tips.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns:**    - **Users Table:** Contains `user_id`, `user_yelping_since_year`, and `user_fans`. This table will help us filter users based on the year they started using Yelp and their follower count.    - **Tips Table:** Contains `user_id`, `business_id`, and `tip_length`. This table will provide the business ID and tip length for the users identified.  3. **Determine the Conditions for Filtering:**    - We need to filter users who started using Yelp in 2004. This corresponds to the condition `user_yelping_since_year = 2004`.    - We also need to filter users who have a high number of followers. Assuming ""high followers"" is represented by the term 'High' in the `user_fans` column, the condition would be `user_fans = 'High'`.  4. **Plan the Join Operation:**    - We need to join the `Users` table with the `Tips` table to get the business ID and tip length for the filtered users.    - The join condition is based on the `user_id` present in both tables: `Users.user_id = Tips.user_id`.  5. **Select the Required Columns:**    - After applying the necessary filters and performing the join, we need to select the columns: `user_id`, `business_id`, and `tip_length`.  6. **Formulate the SQL Query:**    - Using the above logic, we can construct the SQL query as follows:            SELECT T1.user_id, T2.business_id, T2.tip_length      FROM Users AS T1      INNER JOIN Tips AS T2 ON T1.user_id = T2.user_id      WHERE T1.user_yelping_since_year = 2004      AND T1.user_fans = 'High';        7. **Verify and Validate:**    - Ensure that the query accurately reflects the problem statement by checking the conditions and selected columns.    - Validate the query against sample data to ensure it returns the expected results.  By following these steps, we can systematically derive the solution to the problem using SQL.",,

Here is a step-by-step logical breakdown of how to arrive at the solution:  1. **Understand the Requirement**: We need to extract the attribute ID, business ID, and city for businesses with the attribute name ""music_playlist"" that are inactive.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**:     - The `Attributes` table contains information about different attributes, including their IDs and names.    - The `Business_Attributes` table links attributes to businesses via attribute IDs and business IDs.    - The `Business` table contains details about businesses, including their IDs, city, and active status.  3. **Determine Necessary Joins**:    - We need to join the `Attributes` table with the `Business_Attributes` table to find which businesses have the ""music_playlist"" attribute.    - We also need to join the `Business_Attributes` table with the `Business` table to get information about the city and inactive status of these businesses.  4. **Filter by Attribute Name**:    - We need to filter the results to only include rows where the `attribute_name` is ""music_playlist"". This requires a condition on the `Attributes` table.  5. **Filter by Inactive Status**:    - We need to further filter the results to only include businesses that are inactive. This requires a condition on the `Business` table's `active` column.  6. **Select Required Columns**:    - Finally, we select the `attribute_id` from the `Attributes` table, the `business_id` from the `Business_Attributes` table, and the `city` from the `Business` table.  7. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Using the identified tables and conditions, construct the SQL query to retrieve the desired information.  Here is the constructed SQL query based on these steps:   SELECT T1.attribute_id, T2.business_id, T3.city  FROM Attributes AS T1  INNER JOIN Business_Attributes AS T2 ON T1.attribute_id = T2.attribute_id  INNER JOIN Business AS T3 ON T2.business_id = T3.business_id  WHERE T1.attribute_name = 'music_playlist' AND T3.active = 'false';   This query effectively joins the necessary tables, applies the required filters, and selects the specified columns to solve the problem.",,

The goal is to list the user ID and review length of users who had a great experience (indicated by a 5-star review) at businesses in San Tan Valley that have stopped operating. Here are the logical steps to arrive at the solution:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement:**    - We need to identify businesses located in San Tan Valley that are no longer active.    - From these businesses, we need to find reviews where the user gave a 5-star rating, indicating a great experience.    - Finally, we need to extract the user ID and the length of their review.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables:**    - The `Business` table contains information about businesses, including their location (`city`), operational status (`active`), and unique identifier (`business_id`).    - The `Reviews` table contains reviews associated with businesses, including the `business_id`, `user_id`, `review_stars`, and `review_length`.  3. **Determine the Necessary Conditions:**    - We need to filter businesses that are located in San Tan Valley and are no longer active.    - We need to filter reviews with a 5-star rating.  4. **Plan the SQL Query:**    - Start by selecting the necessary columns: `user_id` and `review_length` from the `Reviews` table.    - Use an `INNER JOIN` to connect the `Business` and `Reviews` tables on the `business_id` column, as this is the common key that links reviews to businesses.    - Apply the `WHERE` clause to filter:      - Businesses located in San Tan Valley (`T1.city = 'San Tan Valley'`).      - Businesses that are not active (`T1.active = 'false'`).      - Reviews with a 5-star rating (`T2.review_stars = 5`).  5. **Construct the SQL Query:**    - Combine the above steps into a single SQL query:            SELECT T2.user_id, T2.review_length      FROM Business AS T1      INNER JOIN Reviews AS T2 ON T1.business_id = T2.business_id      WHERE T1.city = 'San Tan Valley'        AND T1.active = 'false'        AND T2.review_stars = 5;        6. **Verify the Query:**    - Ensure that the query correctly joins the tables and applies the necessary filters.    - Check that the selected columns (`user_id` and `review_length`) are returned for reviews that meet all the specified conditions.  By following these logical steps, we can systematically approach the problem and construct an SQL query that meets the requirements of the task.",,

The goal is to find the user's average star rating, elite year, and compliment type when the number of compliments reaches 'Uber'. Here are the logical steps to reach the solution:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to find the average star rating, elite year, and compliment type for a user with ID 6027.    - The condition is that the number of compliments should be 'Uber'.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - **Users Table**: Contains `user_id`, `user_average_stars`.    - **Elite Table**: Contains `user_id`, `year_id` (indicating elite years).    - **Users_Compliments Table**: Contains `user_id`, `compliment_id`, `number_of_compliments`.    - **Compliments Table**: Contains `compliment_id`, `compliment_type`.    - **Years Table**: Contains `year_id`, `actual_year`.  3. **Determine the Relationships Between Tables**:    - The `Elite` table can be joined with the `Users` table using `user_id` to get the user's average stars.    - The `Users_Compliments` table can be joined with the `Compliments` table using `compliment_id` to get the compliment type.    - The `Elite` table can be joined with the `Years` table using `year_id` to get the actual year.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Start by selecting the necessary fields: `user_average_stars`, `year_id`, `compliment_type`, and `number_of_compliments`.    - Use `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on the identified relationships:      - Join `Elite` with `Users` on `user_id`.      - Join `Users_Compliments` with `Compliments` on `compliment_id`.      - Join `Elite` with `Years` on `year_id`.    - Apply the `WHERE` clause to filter records where `user_id` is 6027 and `number_of_compliments` is 'Uber'.  5. **Write the SQL Query**:        SELECT T2.user_average_stars, T1.year_id, T4.compliment_type, T3.number_of_compliments     FROM Elite AS T1     INNER JOIN Users AS T2 ON T1.user_id = T2.user_id     INNER JOIN Users_Compliments AS T3 ON T2.user_id = T3.user_id     INNER JOIN Compliments AS T4 ON T3.compliment_id = T4.compliment_id     INNER JOIN Years AS T5 ON T1.year_id = T5.year_id     WHERE T3.number_of_compliments = 'Uber' AND T3.user_id = 6027;      6. **Verify the Query**:    - Ensure that all joins are correct and that the query retrieves the desired information.    - Check that the filtering condition correctly targets user ID 6027 and the 'Uber' compliment count.

Here are the logical steps that could be taken to reach the solution:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to find categories where the number of businesses associated with them is more than 10% of the total number of businesses across all categories.  2. **Analyze the Schema**:    - The relevant tables for this problem are `Categories` and `Business_Categories`.    - `Categories` table contains `category_id` and `category_name`.    - `Business_Categories` table links `business_id` with `category_id`.  3. **Determine the Total Number of Businesses**:    - First, calculate the total number of businesses across all categories. This can be done by counting distinct `business_id` entries in the `Business_Categories` table.  4. **Calculate the 10% Threshold**:    - Compute 10% of the total number of businesses. This will be used as the threshold to compare against each category's business count.  5. **Count Businesses per Category**:    - For each category, count the number of businesses associated with it. This can be achieved by grouping the `Business_Categories` table by `category_id` and counting the `business_id`.  6. **Filter Categories Exceeding the Threshold**:    - Use a `HAVING` clause to filter categories where the count of businesses exceeds the 10% threshold calculated earlier.  7. **Join with Categories Table**:    - To retrieve the category names, join the filtered results with the `Categories` table on `category_id`.  8. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - The query should select `category_name` from the `Categories` table, join it with `Business_Categories` to get the count of businesses per category, and apply the `HAVING` clause to filter categories exceeding the threshold.  Here is the SQL query that implements these steps:   SELECT T1.category_name  FROM Categories AS T1  INNER JOIN Business_Categories AS T2  ON T1.category_id = T2.category_id  GROUP BY T2.category_id  HAVING COUNT(T2.business_id) > (     SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT T3.business_id)      FROM Business_Categories AS T3 ) * 0.1;   This query effectively identifies and returns the category names that have more than 10% of the total businesses, fulfilling the problem's requirements.",,

This can be done using the `city` and `stars` columns in the `Business` table.  5. **Select Required Information**:    - From the `Reviews` table, we need the `user_id` of users who reviewed the business.    - From the `Users` table, we need the `user_fans` (followers) of these users.  6. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Start by selecting the necessary columns: `user_id` and `user_fans`.    - Use `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Business`, `Reviews`, and `Users` tables based on the relationships identified.    - Apply the filter criteria to select only those businesses in Sun Lakes with a 5-star rating.  7. **Write the SQL Query**:    - The SQL query is constructed as follows:            SELECT T3.user_id, T3.user_fans      FROM Business AS T1      INNER JOIN Reviews AS T2 ON T1.business_id = T2.business_id      INNER JOIN Users AS T3 ON T2.user_id = T3.user_id      WHERE T1.city = 'Sun Lakes' AND T1.stars = 5;        8. **Verify the Query**:    - Ensure that the query correctly joins the tables and applies the filters to return the desired results.

Additionally, we need to retrieve the number of followers (fans) these users have. Here are the logical steps to reach the solution:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement:**    - We need to find the compliment type with the highest number of compliments among users with IDs under 100.    - We also need to retrieve the number of followers (fans) these users have.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns:**    - **Compliments Table:** This table contains information about different types of compliments.    - **Users_Compliments Table:** This table links users to the compliments they received and the number of compliments.    - **Users Table:** This table contains user information, including their number of fans.  3. **Determine the Criteria for ""Highest Quality User"":**    - The problem specifies ""highest quality user"" as those with 'Uber' compliments. Therefore, we need to filter users based on the `number_of_compliments` column in the `Users_Compliments` table.  4. **Filter Users by ID:**    - We need to consider only users with IDs less than 100. This can be done by filtering the `user_id` column in the `Users_Compliments` table.  5. **Join Tables to Gather Required Information:**    - **Join `Compliments` and `Users_Compliments`:** To associate each compliment type with the number of compliments received by users.    - **Join `Users_Compliments` and `Users`:** To get the number of fans for each user.  6. **Select Required Columns:**    - From the `Compliments` table, select the `compliment_type`.    - From the `Users` table, select the `user_fans`.  7. **Apply Filters and Conditions:**    - Use a WHERE clause to filter users with 'Uber' compliments and `user_id` less than 100.  8. **Formulate the SQL Query:**    - Combine all the above steps into a single SQL query using INNER JOINs and WHERE conditions to filter the data as required.  The final SQL query is:  SELECT T1.compliment_type, T3.user_fans  FROM Compliments AS T1  INNER JOIN Users_Compliments AS T2 ON T1.compliment_id = T2.compliment_id  INNER JOIN Users AS T3 ON T2.user_id = T3.user_id  WHERE T2.number_of_compliments = 'Uber' AND T2.user_id < 100;   This query efficiently retrieves the compliment type and the number of fans for the highest quality users with IDs under 100.",,

Here are the steps:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: The task is to list all businesses that close at 8PM. This requires identifying businesses based on their closing time.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**: From the provided schema, identify which tables contain information about business hours. The `Business_Hours` table is relevant as it contains columns related to business operation times, specifically `opening_time` and `closing_time`.  3. **Examine the `Business_Hours` Table**:      - Columns in this table include `business_id`, `day_id`, `opening_time`, and `closing_time`.     - We are interested in the `closing_time` column to find businesses that close at 8PM.  4. **Filter by Closing Time**:      - We need to filter the records where `closing_time` is '8PM'.     - This can be done using a `WHERE` clause in SQL.  5. **Select Distinct Business IDs**:      - Since a business might have multiple entries for different days, we should use `SELECT DISTINCT` to ensure each business is listed only once.     - The `business_id` column will be selected to identify the businesses.  6. **Construct the SQL Query**:      - Combine the above steps into a SQL query:              SELECT DISTINCT business_id FROM Business_Hours WHERE closing_time = '8PM'         7. **Validate the Query**:      - Ensure the query correctly identifies businesses that close at 8PM by checking against sample data or expected results.  By following these logical steps, we can construct the solution to the problem using the provided schema and data.",,

The `Business` table is relevant here.    - Identify the columns in the `Business` table that are necessary for filtering: `city`, `state`, and `stars`.  3. **Formulate the Query**:    - We need to filter businesses based on three conditions:      - The `city` should be 'Phoenix'.      - The `state` should be 'AZ'.      - The `stars` should be 2.    - The SQL `WHERE` clause is used to apply these filters.  4. **Determine the Output**:    - We are asked to count the number of businesses that meet the criteria. Therefore, we use the `COUNT` function to count the number of `business_id`s that satisfy the conditions.  5. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Combine the above steps into a SQL query:            SELECT COUNT(business_id)       FROM Business       WHERE city = 'Phoenix'         AND state = 'AZ'         AND stars = 2;        6. **Verify the Query**:    - Ensure that the query correctly reflects the problem requirements by checking that all conditions are included and the correct table and columns are used.

Here’s how you could approach the problem:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement:**    - We need to determine the number of businesses in a specific city (Tempe) that have a rating indicating a 'Wonderful experience'.  2. **Analyze the Schema:**    - Review the provided schema to identify relevant tables and columns.    - The `Business` table contains information about businesses, including their city and star ratings.  3. **Identify Relevant Columns:**    - From the `Business` table, the `city` column will help filter businesses located in Tempe.    - The `stars` column indicates the rating of the business, which we need to interpret as 'Wonderful experience'.  4. **Define 'Wonderful Experience':**    - Determine what star rating qualifies as a 'Wonderful experience'. Typically, a high rating (e.g., 4 stars or above) might be considered wonderful.  5. **Formulate the SQL Query:**    - Use the `SELECT` statement to count the number of businesses.    - Use the `WHERE` clause to filter businesses located in Tempe and with a star rating that qualifies as 'Wonderful experience'.  6. **Construct the SQL Query:**    - Given the solution provided, the query uses Phoenix and a star rating greater than 3. Assuming 'Wonderful experience' is defined similarly for Tempe, adjust the city filter accordingly.    - The query should look like this:            SELECT COUNT(business_id)       FROM Business       WHERE city = 'Tempe' AND stars > 3;        7. **Verify and Test:**    - Ensure the query logic aligns with the problem requirements.    - Test the query against the database to verify it returns the expected results.

Here’s how you can approach the problem:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: We need to calculate the percentage of businesses that have a 5-star rating. This involves determining how many businesses have a 5-star rating and dividing that by the total number of businesses.  2. **Identify the Relevant Table and Columns**:     - From the schema provided, the `Business` table contains the information we need. Specifically, the `stars` column holds the rating for each business.  3. **Determine the Total Number of Businesses**:    - Use the `COUNT` function to calculate the total number of businesses. This will serve as the denominator in our percentage calculation.  4. **Count the Number of 5-Star Businesses**:    - Use a conditional aggregation to count only those businesses with a 5-star rating. This can be achieved using a `CASE` statement inside the `SUM` function. The `CASE` statement will check if the `stars` column equals 5 and will return 1 for each 5-star business, otherwise 0.  5. **Calculate the Percentage**:    - Divide the count of 5-star businesses by the total number of businesses. Multiply by 100 to convert the result into a percentage.  6. **Ensure Correct Data Type for Division**:    - Since division in SQL can result in integer division, which truncates decimals, ensure that the division operation results in a real number. This can be done by casting the numerator to a `REAL` or `FLOAT` data type before performing the division.  7. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Combine all the above steps into a single SQL query. The query should select the calculated percentage as the result.  Here is the SQL query that implements these steps:   SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN stars = 5 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(stars) FROM Business   - **Explanation of the Query**:   - `SUM(CASE WHEN stars = 5 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)`: This part counts the number of businesses with a 5-star rating.   - `COUNT(stars)`: This counts the total number of businesses.   - `CAST(... AS REAL)`: This ensures that the division results in a real number, allowing for a precise percentage calculation.   - `* 100`: Converts the fraction into a percentage.  By following these logical steps, we can effectively solve the problem and write a query that calculates the percentage of 5-star rated businesses.",,

This requires identifying both the maximum and minimum review counts for businesses.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**: From the provided schema, identify that the `Reviews` table is relevant because it contains the `business_id` column, which links reviews to specific businesses. We need to count the number of reviews per business.  3. **Determine the SQL Operations Needed**:    - We need to group the reviews by `business_id` to count how many reviews each business has.    - We need to find the maximum and minimum counts of these grouped results.  4. **Write a Subquery for Maximum Review Count**:    - Use a subquery to group the reviews by `business_id` and order them in descending order of their counts.    - Select the top result (LIMIT 1) to get the business with the highest number of reviews.  5. **Write a Subquery for Minimum Review Count**:    - Similarly, use another subquery to group the reviews by `business_id` and order them in ascending order of their counts.    - Select the top result (LIMIT 1) to get the business with the lowest number of reviews.  6. **Calculate the Difference**:    - Subtract the minimum review count from the maximum review count to get the desired difference.  7. **Combine the Subqueries**:    - Use a single SQL statement to combine these subqueries and calculate the difference. This can be done using a SELECT statement that subtracts the result of the minimum count subquery from the maximum count subquery.  8. **Alias the Result**:    - Alias the result of the subtraction as `DIFF` for clarity.  By following these steps, you can construct the SQL query to solve the problem:   SELECT      (SELECT COUNT(business_id)       FROM Reviews       GROUP BY business_id       ORDER BY COUNT(business_id) DESC       LIMIT 1)      -      (SELECT COUNT(business_id)       FROM Reviews       GROUP BY business_id       ORDER BY COUNT(business_id) ASC       LIMIT 1)  AS DIFF;   This query effectively calculates the difference between the highest and lowest review counts for businesses.",,

Here's a breakdown of the thought process:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: We need to find businesses that belong to the ""Tires"" category and are open every day of the week.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - **Categories**: To identify businesses in the ""Tires"" category.    - **Business_Categories**: To link businesses with their respective categories.    - **Business_Hours**: To check the days on which each business is open.    - **Business**: To get the list of businesses and ensure they are active.  3. **Determine the Relationships**:    - The `Categories` table can be joined with `Business_Categories` using `category_id` to filter businesses that fall under the ""Tires"" category.    - The `Business_Categories` table can be joined with the `Business` table using `business_id` to ensure we are working with active businesses.    - The `Business` table can be joined with `Business_Hours` using `business_id` to check the days each business is open.  4. **Formulate the Query**:    - Start by selecting the `business_id` from the `Categories` table where `category_name` is ""Tires"".    - Use INNER JOINs to connect `Categories` to `Business_Categories`, then to `Business`, and finally to `Business_Hours`.    - Filter the results to include only businesses that are open every day of the week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can group by `business_id` and use the HAVING clause to ensure that the count of distinct `day_id` entries is 7.  5. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Use `SELECT DISTINCT` to ensure unique business IDs are returned.    - Use `GROUP BY` on `business_id` to aggregate the days each business is open.    - Use `HAVING COUNT(day_id) = 7` to filter businesses open every day.  6. **Verify the Query**:    - Ensure that the query logic aligns with the problem requirements.    - Check that all necessary tables and columns are included and correctly joined.  By following these steps, we construct the SQL query:   SELECT DISTINCT T2.business_id FROM Categories AS T1 INNER JOIN Business_Categories AS T2 ON T1.category_id = T2.category_id INNER JOIN Business AS T3 ON T2.business_id = T3.business_id INNER JOIN Business_Hours AS T4 ON T3.business_id = T4.business_id WHERE T1.category_name = 'Tires' GROUP BY T2.business_id HAVING COUNT(day_id) = 7   This query effectively lists all tire businesses that are open every day of the week.",,

Here's how we can approach it:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to find users who became elite in the year 2012. This means we are interested in users who have been marked as elite specifically in that year.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - From the schema, the `Elite` table is crucial because it contains information about users and the years they became elite. It has columns `user_id` and `year_id`.    - The `Years` table is also relevant because it maps `year_id` to the actual year (`actual_year`).  3. **Determine the Relationship Between Tables**:    - The `Elite` table uses `year_id` to indicate the year a user became elite. To find the actual year (2012), we need to join this table with the `Years` table.    - The `Years` table provides the mapping from `year_id` to `actual_year`.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - We need to perform an INNER JOIN between the `Elite` and `Years` tables. This join will allow us to filter records where the `actual_year` is 2012.    - The SQL query should select distinct `user_id` values from the `Elite` table where the corresponding `actual_year` is 2012.  5. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Use the SELECT statement to retrieve `user_id` from the `Elite` table.    - Use the INNER JOIN clause to join the `Elite` table with the `Years` table on the `year_id` column.    - Use the WHERE clause to filter the results to only include records where `actual_year` is 2012.    - Use DISTINCT to ensure that each `user_id` is listed only once in the result set.  6. **Verify the Solution**:    - Ensure that the query logic aligns with the problem requirements and that all necessary columns and conditions are included.  By following these steps, we can derive the solution to the problem. The final SQL query is:   SELECT DISTINCT T1.user_id  FROM Elite AS T1  INNER JOIN Years AS T2 ON T1.year_id = T2.year_id  WHERE T2.actual_year = 2012;   This query effectively identifies all unique users who became elite in the year 2012.",,

Here's how we can approach this:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: We need to find the number of businesses with low check-ins on Sunday at 10 AM. This requires us to focus on the `Checkins` table where check-in data is stored.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - The `Days` table provides the mapping between `day_id` and the actual day of the week.    - The `Checkins` table contains check-in data for each business, with columns representing different times of the day. Specifically, `label_time_10` corresponds to check-ins at 10 AM.  3. **Determine the Necessary Conditions**:    - We need to filter the data to only include check-ins on Sundays. This can be achieved by joining the `Days` table with the `Checkins` table on the `day_id` column and filtering for `day_of_week = 'Sunday'`.    - We also need to check for low check-ins at 10 AM, which is indicated by the value 'Low' in the `label_time_10` column of the `Checkins` table.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Start by selecting the `business_id` from the `Checkins` table, as we need to count the businesses.    - Perform an INNER JOIN between the `Days` table and the `Checkins` table on the `day_id` to filter the records for Sundays.    - Apply a WHERE clause to filter the records where `day_of_week` is 'Sunday' and `label_time_10` is 'Low'.    - Use the `COUNT` function to count the number of distinct `business_id`s that meet these criteria.  5. **Write the SQL Query**:        SELECT COUNT(T2.business_id)    FROM Days AS T1    INNER JOIN Checkins AS T2 ON T1.day_id = T2.day_id    WHERE T1.day_of_week = 'Sunday' AND T2.label_time_10 = 'Low';      6. **Verify the Solution**:    - Ensure that the query correctly joins the tables and applies the filters.    - Check that the query counts the correct number of businesses with low check-ins at the specified time.  By following these steps, we can systematically arrive at the solution to the problem, ensuring that all relevant conditions are considered and applied correctly in the SQL query.",,

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: We need to identify the locations (cities) where businesses categorized as ""Pet Services"" are located.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**: Based on the schema provided, we need to determine which tables contain the necessary information:    - The `Business` table contains information about each business, including its location (city).    - The `Business_Categories` table links businesses to their respective categories.    - The `Categories` table contains the names of the categories, including ""Pet Services"".  3. **Determine the Relationships**:     - The `Business_Categories` table acts as a bridge between the `Business` and `Categories` tables. It links each business to one or more categories through `business_id` and `category_id`.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - **Select Clause**: We want to retrieve the `city` from the `Business` table.    - **From Clause**: Start with the `Business` table as it contains the `city` information.    - **Join Operations**:       - Use an `INNER JOIN` to connect the `Business` table with the `Business_Categories` table on `business_id` to access the category information for each business.      - Use another `INNER JOIN` to connect the `Business_Categories` table with the `Categories` table on `category_id` to filter for the ""Pet Services"" category.    - **Where Clause**: Filter the results to include only those rows where the `category_name` in the `Categories` table is ""Pet Services"".  5. **Construct the Final Query**:    - Combine all the above steps into a coherent SQL query:            SELECT T1.city       FROM Business AS T1       INNER JOIN Business_Categories AS T2 ON T1.business_id = T2.business_id       INNER JOIN Categories AS T3 ON T2.category_id = T3.category_id       WHERE T3.category_name = 'Pet Services'        6. **Verify the Query**: Ensure that the query logically retrieves the correct information by checking the relationships and conditions specified in the query against the schema.  By following these steps, we can derive the SQL query that correctly identifies the locations of all businesses categorized under ""Pet Services"".",,

Here's how you can approach the problem:  1. **Understand the Requirement**:     - We need to count businesses that are closed and have more than 10 distinct attributes.    - A business is considered closed if its `active` status is `false`.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**:    - The `Business` table contains information about whether a business is active or not.    - The `Business_Attributes` table contains information about the attributes associated with each business.  3. **Filter Closed Businesses**:    - Start by filtering businesses that are closed. This can be done by selecting entries from the `Business` table where the `active` column is `false`.  4. **Join Tables**:    - To find the attributes associated with each business, perform an INNER JOIN between the `Business` table and the `Business_Attributes` table on the `business_id` column.  5. **Group and Count Attributes**:    - Group the results by `business_id` to aggregate all attributes for each business.    - Use the `COUNT(DISTINCT attribute_id)` function to count the number of distinct attributes for each business.  6. **Apply the Condition on Attribute Count**:    - Use a HAVING clause to filter groups (businesses) where the count of distinct attributes is greater than 10.  7. **Count the Resulting Businesses**:    - Finally, count the number of businesses that satisfy the condition using the `COUNT(*)` function.  8. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Combine all the above steps into a single SQL query.  Here's the step-by-step SQL query based on the above reasoning:   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Business WHERE business_id IN (     SELECT T1.business_id     FROM Business AS T1     INNER JOIN Business_Attributes AS T2 ON T1.business_id = T2.business_id     WHERE T1.active = 'false'     GROUP BY T1.business_id     HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT T2.attribute_id) > 10 );   - **Explanation of the Query**:   - The subquery selects `business_id` from the joined tables where the business is closed (`active = 'false'`).   - It groups the results by `business_id` and filters those groups to include only businesses with more than 10 distinct attributes.   - The outer query counts how many such businesses exist.  By following these logical steps, we ensure that the solution is both correct and efficient, addressing the problem requirements directly.",,

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logical reasoning process to arrive at the solution:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: We need to find businesses located in Mesa that have an attribute related to alcohol.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**:    - **Business**: This table contains information about businesses, including their location (city).    - **Business_Attributes**: This table links businesses to their attributes.    - **Attributes**: This table provides the names of attributes, including ""Alcohol"".  3. **Determine Necessary Joins**:    - To link businesses to their attributes, we need to join the `Business` table with the `Business_Attributes` table using the `business_id`.    - To identify which attributes are related to alcohol, we need to join the `Business_Attributes` table with the `Attributes` table using the `attribute_id`.  4. **Filter by Location**:    - Since we are only interested in businesses located in Mesa, we need to filter the results from the `Business` table where the `city` column is 'Mesa'.  5. **Filter by Attribute**:    - We need to filter the attributes to only include those that are related to alcohol. This requires filtering the `Attributes` table where the `attribute_name` is 'Alcohol'.  6. **Select Required Columns**:    - The final output should list the `business_id` of businesses that meet the criteria. Therefore, we select the `business_id` from the `Business` table.  7. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Combine the above steps into a single SQL query using `INNER JOIN` to connect the tables and `WHERE` clauses to apply the necessary filters.  The resulting SQL query is:  SELECT T1.business_id FROM Business AS T1 INNER JOIN Business_Attributes AS T2 ON T1.business_id = T2.business_id INNER JOIN Attributes AS T3 ON T2.attribute_id = T3.attribute_id WHERE T1.city = 'Mesa' AND T3.attribute_name = 'Alcohol'   This query effectively retrieves the `business_id` of businesses located in Mesa that have an alcohol attribute, following the logical steps outlined above.",,
