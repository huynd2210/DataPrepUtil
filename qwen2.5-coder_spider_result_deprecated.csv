### Explanation:
1. **Join `invoices` and `customers` tables**: We join these two tables on the `customer_id` to link each invoice with its corresponding customer.
2. **Group by country**: We group the results by the `country` column from the `customers` table to aggregate the total gross invoice size for each country.
3. **Calculate the total gross invoice size**: We use the `SUM` function on the `total` column from the `invoices` table to calculate the total gross invoice size for each country.
4. **Order by total gross invoice size in descending order**: We order the results by the calculated `gross_invoice_size` in descending order to get the countries with the highest gross invoice sizes at the top.
5. **Limit the results to 8**: Finally, we limit the result set to the top 8 countries.

1. Identify the table that contains information about media types (`media_types`).
2. Identify the table that contains information about genres (`genres`).
3. Identify the table that contains information about tracks (`tracks`), which links genres and media types.
4. Use JOINs to connect the `media_types`, `genres`, and `tracks` tables based on their IDs.

The SQL query will look for rows in the `media_types` table where the name is 'MPEG audio file', and then find corresponding tracks in the `tracks` table that have this media type ID. Additionally, we need to ensure that these tracks belong to the Rock genre.

1435,spider_data/database/college_2/college_2.sqlite,"To solve this problem, we need to find the names of all instructors who advise students in the Math department and sort them by the total credits of the students they advise.

Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify Students in the Math Department**: We need to select students from the `student` table where `dept_name = 'Math'`.

2. **Find Advisors for These Students**: Using the `advisor` table, we can find the advisors (instructors) who advise these math students.

3. **Get Instructor Names**: Finally, we retrieve the names of these instructors from the `instructor` table.

4. **Sort by Total Credits**: We need to ensure that the final list is sorted by the total credits (`tot_cred`) of the students they advise.

Here's the SQL query that accomplishes this:


SELECT i.name
FROM instructor i
WHERE i.ID IN (
    SELECT a.i_ID
    FROM advisor a
    WHERE a.s_ID IN (
        SELECT s.ID
        FROM student s

    JOIN advisor a ON s.ID = a.s_ID
    JOIN instructor i2 ON a.i_ID = i2.ID
    WHERE i2.ID = i.ID
) DESC;


### Explanation:
- **Subquery to Get Advisors**: 
  - `SELECT a.i_ID FROM advisor a WHERE a.s_ID IN (SELECT s.ID FROM student s WHERE s.dept_name = 'Math')`
  - This subquery finds all instructor IDs (`i_ID`) that advise students in the Math department.

- **Main Query**:
  - `SELECT i.name FROM instructor i WHERE i.ID IN (...)`
  - This selects the names of instructors whose IDs are found in the subquery.

- **Sorting by Total Credits**:
  - The outer query sorts these instructors by the total credits (`tot_cred`) of the students they advise.
  - The inner subquery calculates the sum of `tot_cred` for each instructor who advises students in the Math department.

This query will give you the names of all instructors who advise students in the Math department, sorted by the total credits of the students they advise.

1570,spider_data/database/customers_and_invoices/customers_and_invoices.sqlite,"To solve this problem, we need to retrieve the full names and IDs of all customers along with the number of accounts each customer has. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Select the required columns from the `Customers` table**: We need the `customer_id`, `customer_first_name`, `customer_middle_initial`, and `customer_last_name`.

2. **Count the number of accounts per customer**: This requires joining the `Accounts` table with the `Customers` table on the `customer_id` column.

3. **Group the results by customer ID**: This will ensure that we get a count of accounts for each customer.

4. **Use an aggregate function to count the accounts**: We can use the `COUNT()` function to count the number of accounts per customer.

Here is the SQL query that accomplishes this:


SELECT 
    c.customer_id,
    CONCAT(c.customer_first_name, ' ', c.customer_middle_initial, ' ', c.customer_last_name) AS full_name,

GROUP BY 
    c.customer_id, c.customer_first_name, c.customer_middle_initial, c.customer_last_name;


### Explanation:
- **SELECT**: We select the `customer_id` and concatenate the `customer_first_name`, `customer_middle_initial`, and `customer_last_name` to form the full name.
- **FROM Customers c**: This specifies that we are selecting from the `Customers` table and aliasing it as `c`.
- **LEFT JOIN Accounts a ON c.customer_id = a.customer_id**: We join the `Accounts` table (aliased as `a`) with the `Customers` table on the `customer_id` column to link each customer with their accounts.
- **COUNT(a.account_id)**: This counts the number of accounts for each customer.
- **GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.customer_first_name, c.customer_middle_initial, c.customer_last_name**: This groups the results by the customer ID and full name so that the count is calculated per customer.

This query will provide you with the full names and IDs of all customers along with the number of accounts each has.

This query works as follows:
1. The subquery `(SELECT MAX(Days_held) FROM wrestler)` finds the maximum number of days held by any wrestler.
2. The main query joins the `wrestler` table with the `Elimination` table on the `Wrestler_ID` column to link each wrestler with their elimination records.
3. It then filters the joined records to include only those where the `Days_held` is equal to the maximum number of days held found in the subquery.
4. Finally, it selects the `Time` column from the `Elimination` table for these filtered records.

1. **Join Tables**: We start by joining the `Customers` table with the `Bookings` table to link each customer with their booking history.
2. **Filter by Coupon Amount**: We then join the `Discount_Coupons` table to filter only those customers who have a coupon with an amount of 500.
3. **Count Distinct Bookings**: For each customer, we count the number of distinct bookings they have made. If a customer has made more than 5 unique bookings, their status is marked as ""Good""; otherwise, it's marked as ""Bad"".
4. **Group By Customer**: Finally, we group the results by customer to ensure we get one row per customer with their initial and final statuses.

This query will provide a list of customers who have used a 500-coupon amount and whether they are considered ""good"" or ""bad"" based on their booking activity.

1. **Join the `drivers`, `results`, and `races` tables**: We need to join these three tables to link drivers with their race participation.
   - `drivers (d)` is joined with `results (r)` on `driverId`.
   - `results (r)` is joined with `races (ra)` on `raceId`.

2. **Filter races by name**: Use the `WHERE` clause to filter the races by names ""Australian Grand Prix"" and ""Chinese Grand Prix"".

3. **Group by driver id and forename**: Group the results by `driverId` and `forename` to aggregate data for each driver.

4. **Count distinct race names**: Use the `COUNT(DISTINCT ra.name)` to count how many different race names each driver participated in.

5. **Filter groups with exactly two race names**: Use the `HAVING` clause to filter groups where the driver has participated in exactly two different races (i.e., both the Australian and Chinese Grand Prix).

This query will return the `driverId` and `forename` of drivers who have participated in both specified races.

1. **Identify Relevant Tables**: We need data from `drivers`, `results`, and potentially `races` to identify drivers who have participated in at least 2 races.

2. **Join Tables**: 
   - Join `drivers` with `results` on `driverId` to link each driver with their participation in races.
   - Optionally, join `results` with `races` on `raceId` to get race details if needed.

3. **Filter and Group**:
   - Filter the joined data to include only those records where the race is not null (to ensure we are considering valid race participations).
   - Group the results by `driverId` to aggregate data for each driver.
   - Use the `COUNT(*)` function to count the number of races each driver has participated in.

4. **Filter Results**:
   - Apply a condition in the `HAVING` clause to ensure only drivers with at least 2 race participations are included in the final result.

5. **Select Required Columns**:
   - Select the `driverId`, `forename`, and count of races (`COUNT(*)`) from the grouped results.

1. **Identify the campus with the most degrees in 2002**: This can be done by querying the `degrees` table for the sum of degrees conferred in 2002 and ordering the results in descending order.

2. **Get the faculty lines for that campus in 2002**: Once we have the campus ID, we can query the `faculty` table to find the number of faculty lines for that campus in 2002.

Here is the SQL query to achieve this:


SELECT f.Faculty
FROM faculty f
JOIN (
    SELECT d.Campus
    FROM degrees d
    WHERE d.Year = 2002
    ORDER BY d.Degrees DESC
    LIMIT 1
) sub ON f.Campus = sub.Campus AND f.Year = 2002;


Explanation:
- The inner query selects the campus ID (`d.Campus`) from the `degrees` table where the year is 2002, orders the results by the number of degrees in descending order, and limits the result to the top one (i.e., the campus with the most degrees).
- The outer query then joins this subquery with the `faculty` table to get the faculty lines for that campus in the year 2002.

This query will return the number of faculty lines at the university that conferred the most number of degrees in 2002.

- The outer query then joins this subquery with the `faculty` table to get the faculty lines for that campus in the year 2002.

This query will return the number of faculty lines at the university that conferred the most number of degrees in 2002.': near ""To"": syntax error",SELECT T2.faculty FROM campuses AS T1 JOIN faculty AS T2 ON T1.id  =  t2.campus JOIN degrees AS T3 ON T1.id  =  t3.campus AND t2.year  =  t3.year WHERE t2.year  =  2002 ORDER BY t3.degrees DESC LIMIT 1,How many faculty lines are there in the university that conferred the most number of degrees in year 2002?,False
2381,spider_data/database/csu_1/csu_1.sqlite,"To solve this problem, we need to find the university that conferred the most degrees in 2002 and then determine how many faculty members worked at that university in 2002.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Find the campus that conferred the most degrees in 2002**:
   - Select the `Campus` column from the `degrees` table where the `Year` is 2002.
   - Order the results by the `Degrees` column in descending order to get the campus with the highest number of degrees at the top.
   - Limit the result to only one row using `LIMIT 1`.

2. **Find the number of faculty members at that campus in 2002**:
   - Select the `Faculty` column from the `faculty` table where the `Year` is 2002 and the `Campus` matches the campus found in step 1.

Here's the SQL query that combines these steps:


SELECT f.Faculty
FROM faculty f
JOIN (
    SELECT d.Campus
    FROM degrees d
    WHERE d.Year = 2002
    ORDER BY d.Degrees DESC
    LIMIT 1
) campus ON f.Campus = campus.Campus AND f.Year = 2002;


This query first identifies the campus with the highest number of degrees in 2002 and then retrieves the faculty count for that campus in the same year.

### Explanation:
1. **Join Condition**: We join the `county` table (`c`) with the `election` table (`e`) on the condition that the county code in the election is present in the list of county IDs.
2. **Subquery to Extract County Codes**:
   - The subquery uses `SUBSTRING_INDEX` and `REPLACE` functions to extract individual county codes from the `Counties_Represented` column.
   - `numbers` table generates a sequence of numbers (1 through 10) to handle up to 10 counties represented in an election.
3. **Filter Non-Null Values**: The subquery ensures that only non-null values are processed.

This query will return the name of each county and the delegate associated with it for each county.

Explanation:
1. **Sequence Function**: The `sequence` function generates a series of numbers (from 1 to 20 in this case). This is used to split the `Counties_Represented` column, which contains county codes separated by spaces and possibly other characters.
2. **SUBSTRING_INDEX**: Used to extract individual county codes from the `Counties_Represented` string.
3. **TRIM**: Removes any leading or trailing spaces from the extracted county code.

- We then join the `Engineer_Visits` table with the `Maintenance_Engineers` table on the `engineer_id` column to get the engineer details for each visit.
- We group the results by `engineer_id`, `first_name`, and `last_name` to aggregate the visits per engineer.
- We order the grouped results by the count of `engineer_visit_id` in ascending order to find the engineer with the least number of visits.
- Finally, we limit the result to only one row using `LIMIT 1` to get the engineer who has made the least number of visits.

1. **Identify the subquery**: First, we need to calculate the average resolution of songs in the ""modern"" genre.
2. **Compare resolutions**: Then, we will select the song IDs from the `song` table where the resolution is greater than the average calculated in the subquery.

Here is the SQL query that accomplishes this:


SELECT s.f_id AS song_id
FROM song s
WHERE s.resolution > (
    SELECT AVG(s2.resolution)
    FROM song s2
    WHERE s2.genre_is = 'modern'
);


### Explanation:
- **Subquery**: The subquery `(SELECT AVG(s2.resolution) FROM song s2 WHERE s2.genre_is = 'modern')` calculates the average resolution of songs in the ""modern"" genre.
- **Main Query**: The main query selects the `f_id` (song ID) from the `song` table where the `resolution` is greater than the average resolution calculated by the subquery.

This will give you the IDs of all songs whose resolution is higher than the average resolution of songs in the ""modern"" genre.

To answer this question, we need to find the average attendance of all teams that played their home games at Riverside Park between 1960 and 2000. 

Here's a step-by-step approach to derive the SQL query:

1. **Identify the relevant table**: The information about team attendance is stored in the `team` table.

2. **Filter by date range**: We need to filter the data for teams that played their home games between 1960 and 2000. This can be done using the `BETWEEN` operator on the `year` column.

3. **Filter by park**: We also need to filter the data for teams that played their home games at Riverside Park. This can be done by checking if the `park` column is equal to 'Riverside Park'.

4. **Calculate average attendance**: Finally, we need to calculate the average attendance of these teams. This can be done using the `AVG` function on the `attendance` column.

Putting it all together, we get the following SQL query

Therefore, the final answer is:


SELECT AVG(attendance) FROM team WHERE park = 'Riverside Park' AND year BETWEEN 1960 AND 2000

To answer this question, we need to find the team that won the World Series (WS) championship and then retrieve the corresponding data from the team table.

1. We start by identifying the relevant tables: team, postseason, and team_franchise.

2. The postseason table contains information about each season's playoff results, including the winner. We will use this table to find the winning team for a specific year (e.g., 1884).

3. However, the postseason table does not directly contain the winning team's name or ID. Instead, it contains the winner's team_id, which can be used to join with the team table.

4. The team Franchise table is used to map franchise IDs to their names.

5. We will use a subquery in the WHERE clause of our main query to find the winning team for a specific year (e.g., 1884).

6. Once we have the winning team's ID, we can join with the team table and the team Franchise table to retrieve the desired information.

7. Finally, we will use the SELECT statement to specify the columns we want to retrieve from the team and team Franchise tables.

Therefore, the final answer is:


SELECT T1.name, T2.franchise_name, T1.ipouts

1. **Identify high-cost procedures**:
   - `SELECT p.Name FROM Procedures p WHERE p.Cost > 1000`
   This part selects the names of all procedures that cost more than $1000.

2. **Exclude procedures John Wen is trained in**:
   - `NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM Trained_In ti JOIN Physician ph ON ti.Physician = ph.EmployeeID WHERE ph.Name = 'John Wen' AND ti.Treatment = p.Code)`

Here's a step-by-step approach to constructing the SQL query:

1. **Identify Projects with Specific Details**: We need to find projects where the `project_details` column in the `Projects` table contains 'omnis'.

2. **Count Project Outcomes**: We need to count the number of outcomes for each project using the `Project_Outcomes` table.

3. **Filter Projects with at Least 3 Outcomes**: We will filter out projects that have fewer than 3 outcomes.

4. **Join Tables to Retrieve Task Details**: We will join the necessary tables to retrieve task details, task IDs, and project IDs.

Here is the SQL query that accomplishes this:

Explanation:

  - `ProjectsWithDetails`: Selects project IDs where the `project_details` is 'omnis'.
  - `ProjectsWithOutcomes`: Filters projects that have at least 3 outcomes.
  
- **Main Query**:
  - Joins the `Tasks` table with both CTEs to retrieve task details, task IDs, and project IDs for the filtered projects.

This query ensures that we get the required details for projects that are detailed as 'omnis' or have at least 3 outcomes.

2. Friends of people living in Austin.

Then, we can exclude the friends from the list of all people and get the remaining people as those with no friends living in Austin.

Here is a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. Get the list of people who live in Austin:
   `SELECT name FROM Person WHERE city = 'Austin'`

2. Get the list of friends of people living in Austin:
   `SELECT friend FROM PersonFriend WHERE name IN (SELECT name FROM Person WHERE city = 'Austin')`

3. Exclude the friends from the list of all people and get the remaining people:

1. Identify all people who are friends with Alice.
2. Identify all people who are friends with those people identified in step 1 (these are Alice's friends of friends).
3. Exclude anyone who is directly friends with Alice from the list obtained in step 2.

)
AND pf2.friend NOT IN (

### Explanation:
- `pf1` is the table alias for the first instance of `PersonFriend`, representing Alice's friends.
- `pf2` is the table alias for the second instance of `PersonFriend`, representing friends of Alice's friends.
- The subquery inside the `WHERE` clause identifies all people who are friends with Alice (`SELECT friend FROM PersonFriend WHERE name = 'Alice'`).
- The subquery inside the `AND` condition ensures that we exclude anyone who is directly friends with Alice (`pf2.friend NOT IN (SELECT friend FROM PersonFriend WHERE name = 'Alice')`).

This query will give you a list of people who are friends of friends with Alice, excluding those who are directly friends with her.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify the most common role**: We can do this by counting the number of users for each role and selecting the role with the highest count.
2. **Retrieve the usernames and passwords of users with the most common role**: Once we know the role, we can select the `user_name` and `password` columns from the `Users` table where the `role_code` matches the most common role.

- The `GROUP BY role_code` and `ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC LIMIT 1` part of the query finds the role with the highest count.
- In the main query, we join the `Users` table with the `MostCommonRole` CTE to get the usernames and passwords of users who have the most common role.

### Explanation:
- **JOINs**: The query joins the `Department_Stores`, `Departments`, and `Staff_Department_Assignments` tables to get the necessary information about departments within each store.
- **WHERE Clause**: Filters the records where the job title is either 'Marketing Manager' or 'Department Manager'.
- **GROUP BY**: Groups the results by department store ID and name to aggregate the data.
- **HAVING Clause**: Ensures that there are both marketing managers and department managers assigned to each store.

This query will return the IDs and names of department stores that have at least one marketing manager and one department manager.

### Explanation:
- **JOINs**: The query joins the `Department_Stores`, `Departments`, and `Staff_Department_Assignments` tables to get the necessary information about departments within each store.
- **WHERE Clause**: Filters the records where the job title is either 'Marketing Manager' or 'Department Manager'.
- **GROUP BY**: Groups the results by department store ID and name to aggregate the data.
- **HAVING Clause**: Ensures that there are both marketing managers and department managers assigned to each store.

This query will return the IDs and names of department stores that have at least one marketing manager and one department manager.': near ""To"": syntax error","SELECT T2.dept_store_id ,  T2.store_name FROM departments AS T1 JOIN department_stores AS T2 ON T1.dept_store_id  =  T2.dept_store_id WHERE T1.department_name  =  ""marketing"" INTERSECT SELECT T2.dept_store_id ,  T2.store_name FROM departments AS T1 JOIN department_stores AS T2 ON T1.dept_store_id  =  T2.dept_store_id WHERE T1.department_name  =  ""managing""",What are the ids and names of department stores with both marketing and managing departments?,False

4790,spider_data/database/department_store/department_store.sqlite,"To solve this problem, you need to identify staff who have held the title ""Sales Person"" but never held the title ""Clerical Staff"". Here's a step-by-step approach to derive the SQL query:

1. **Identify the relevant tables**: You need information from the `Staff`, `Staff_Department_Assignments`, and potentially other related tables.

2. **Filter for Sales Persons**: Select staff who have held the title ""Sales Person"".

3. **Exclude Clerical Staff**: Exclude staff who have ever held the title ""Clerical Staff"".

4. **Combine the conditions**: Use a combination of `WHERE` clauses to filter the results accordingly.

Here is the SQL query that achieves this:


SELECT s.staff_id, s.staff_name, s.staff_gender
FROM Staff s
JOIN Staff_Department_Assignments sda ON s.staff_id = sda.staff_id
WHERE sda.job_title_code = 'Sales Person'

    FROM Staff_Department_Assignments sda2
    WHERE sda2.staff_id = sda.staff_id
      AND sda2.job_title_code = 'Clerical Staff'
);


### Explanation:
- **JOIN Clause**: Joins the `Staff` table with the `Staff_Department_Assignments` table on `staff_id`.
- **WHERE Clause**: Filters staff who have held the title ""Sales Person"".
- **Subquery**: The subquery finds the earliest date when any staff member has been assigned to a ""Clerical Staff"" role. The outer query then excludes staff members whose most recent assignment was before this date.

This query will give you the names and genders of staff who have held the title ""Sales Person"" but never held the title ""Clerical Staff"".

2. **FROM Vocals v**: We are selecting from the `Vocals` table and aliasing it as `v`.
3. **GROUP BY v.SongId**: We group the results by `SongId` to aggregate the data for each song.
4. **HAVING COUNT(v.Bandmate) > 1**: This condition ensures that only songs with more than one vocal (i.e., shared vocals) are counted.

1. **Find the earliest date a problem was reported by Lysanne Turcotte**: This involves querying the `Problem_Log` table and filtering by the staff ID of Lysanne Turcotte.
2. **Find all problems reported before that date**: Use the date obtained from step 1 to filter problems in the `Problems` table.

Here is the SQL query to achieve this:

);


### Explanation:
- The subquery `(SELECT MIN(pl.log_entry_date) ...)` finds the earliest date a problem was reported by Lysanne Turcotte.
  - It joins the `Problem_Log` table with the `Staff` table to filter records where the staff first name is 'Lysanne' and the last name is 'Turcotte'.
  - It then selects the minimum log entry date from these filtered records.
- The outer query selects the problem IDs (`p.problem_id`) from the `Problems` table where the problem was reported before this earliest date.

This query will give you the IDs of all problems reported before any problem reported by Lysanne Turcotte.

### Explanation:
1. **Joining Tables**:
   - We start by joining the `Visitors` table with the `Visits` table on `Tourist_ID` to get the visits made by each tourist.
   - Then, we join the `Visits` table with the `Tourist_Attractions` table on `Tourist_Attraction_ID` to get the details of the attractions visited.

2. **Filtering for Alison**:
   - We filter the results to only include rows where the `Tourist_Details` column in the `Visitors` table is 'Alison'.

3. **Excluding Visits by Rosalind**:
   - We use a subquery with the `NOT EXISTS` clause to exclude any attractions that Rosalind visited.
   - The subquery joins the `Visitors`, `Visits`, and `Tourist_Attractions` tables similarly, but it filters for 'Rosalind' instead of 'Alison'.
   - If Rosalind visited the attraction, the subquery will return a row, and the `NOT EXISTS` clause will exclude that attraction from the main query.

4. **Selecting Unique Attractions**:
   - Finally, we select distinct names of the attractions using `DISTINCT`.

This query will give you the names of tourist attractions that Alison visited but Rosalind did not visit.

This query works as follows:
- Joins the `airports` table with the `routes` table on the source airport ID (`src_apid`) to get the airports from which airlines operate.
- Groups the results by country.
- Counts the distinct airline IDs (`alid`) for each group to determine how many different airlines operate out of each country.
- Orders the results in descending order based on the number of airlines.': near ""To"": syntax error","SELECT country ,  count(*) FROM airlines GROUP BY country ORDER BY count(*) DESC",How many airlines operate out of each country in descending order?,False
