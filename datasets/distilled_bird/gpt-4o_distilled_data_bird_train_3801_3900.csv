Here’s how we can break down the problem and arrive at the solution:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: We need to find the number of businesses that have a category and are open from Monday to Thursday. This requires us to consider both the business categories and their operating hours.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**: From the schema provided, the relevant tables are:    - `Categories`: Contains information about different business categories.    - `Business_Categories`: Links businesses to their respective categories.    - `Business`: Contains general information about businesses.    - `Business_Hours`: Contains information about the operating hours of businesses.    - `Days`: Provides a mapping of day IDs to actual days of the week.  3. **Determine Necessary Joins**:    - To link businesses with their categories, we need to join `Categories` with `Business_Categories` on `category_id`.    - To get the business details, join `Business_Categories` with `Business` on `business_id`.    - To find the operating hours, join `Business` with `Business_Hours` on `business_id`.    - Finally, to translate `day_id` to actual days of the week, join `Business_Hours` with `Days` on `day_id`.  4. **Filter for Specific Days**: We are interested in businesses that are open from Monday to Thursday. Therefore, we need to filter the results where the `day_of_week` is either 'Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', or 'Thursday'.  5. **Count Distinct Businesses**: Since we want the number of businesses, we need to count the distinct `business_id`s that meet the criteria.  6. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Start by selecting the count of distinct `business_id`s.    - Perform the necessary joins between the identified tables.    - Apply the filter to select only the days from Monday to Thursday.    - Ensure the query logic correctly reflects the requirement to count businesses open on any of these days.  7. **Review and Optimize**: Ensure the query is efficient and correctly captures the requirement. Check for potential optimizations, such as ensuring indexes are used on join columns.  By following these steps, we arrive at the solution:   SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT T2.business_id) FROM Categories AS T1 INNER JOIN Business_Categories AS T2 ON T1.category_id = T2.category_id INNER JOIN Business AS T3 ON T2.business_id = T3.business_id INNER JOIN Business_Hours AS T4 ON T3.business_id = T4.business_id INNER JOIN Days AS T5 ON T4.day_id = T5.day_id WHERE T5.day_of_week IN ('Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday')   This query effectively counts the number of businesses that have a category and are open on any of the specified days.",,

Here is a breakdown of the reasoning process:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to list the names of businesses with a rating (stars) less than 5.    - These businesses should belong to the category ""Men's Clothing"".  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - We need information about business ratings, business names, and their categories.    - From the schema, the relevant tables are `Business`, `Categories`, and `Business_Categories`.  3. **Determine the Relationships Between Tables**:    - The `Business` table contains business information, including `business_id` and `stars`.    - The `Categories` table contains category information, including `category_id` and `category_name`.    - The `Business_Categories` table links businesses to categories using `business_id` and `category_id`.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Start by joining the `Categories` and `Business_Categories` tables to filter businesses that fall under the ""Men's Clothing"" category.      - Use an `INNER JOIN` to connect `Categories` and `Business_Categories` on `category_id`.      - Add a `WHERE` clause to filter for `category_name` matching ""Men's Clothing"".    - Next, join the result with the `Business` table to access the business ratings.      - Use another `INNER JOIN` to connect `Business_Categories` and `Business` on `business_id`.      - Add a condition to the `WHERE` clause to filter businesses with `stars` less than 5.  5. **Execute the Query**:    - The final SQL query should look like this:            SELECT T2.business_id       FROM Categories AS T1       INNER JOIN Business_Categories AS T2 ON T1.category_id = T2.category_id       INNER JOIN Business AS T3 ON T2.business_id = T3.business_id       WHERE T1.category_name LIKE 'Men''s Clothing' AND T3.stars < 5          - This query selects the `business_id` of businesses that are in the ""Men's Clothing"" category and have a rating of less than 5.  6. **Verify and Validate**:    - Ensure that the query logic aligns with the problem requirements.    - Check if the query correctly joins the tables and applies the necessary filters.  By following these steps, we can systematically approach the problem and construct a solution that retrieves the desired business information based on the given criteria.",,

By following these steps, you can logically derive the solution to the problem. The final SQL query is:   SELECT DISTINCT T1.business_id FROM Reviews AS T1 INNER JOIN Business AS T2 ON T1.business_id = T2.business_id WHERE T2.active LIKE 'FALSE' AND T1.review_votes_useful LIKE 'Low'   This query effectively identifies businesses that are no longer active and have received low useful votes in their reviews.",,

Here's the SQL query that implements these steps:   SELECT T2.business_name FROM Reviews AS T1 INNER JOIN Business AS T2 ON T1.business_id = T2.business_id WHERE T1.review_length = 'Long' AND T2.business_id BETWEEN 1 AND 20 GROUP BY T2.business_name;   **Explanation of the Query:** - **SELECT T2.business_name:** We want to retrieve the business names. - **FROM Reviews AS T1:** Start with the `Reviews` table, alias it as T1. - **INNER JOIN Business AS T2 ON T1.business_id = T2.business_id:** Join with the `Business` table to get the business names, using `business_id` as the key. - **WHERE T1.review_length = 'Long':** Filter for reviews that are marked as ""Long."" - **AND T2.business_id BETWEEN 1 AND 20:** Further filter to include only businesses with IDs from 1 to 20. - **GROUP BY T2.business_name:** Group by business name to ensure each name is listed once.  By following these logical steps, we ensure that the solution is both accurate and efficient in addressing the problem statement.",,

Here's how we can approach the problem:  1. **Understand the Schema and Relationships**:     - We have multiple tables, but the relevant ones for this problem are `Business`, `Business_Attributes`, `Business_Categories`, and `Categories`.    - `Business` contains information about each business, including its city.    - `Business_Attributes` links businesses to their attributes.    - `Business_Categories` links businesses to their categories.    - `Categories` provides the names for each category.  2. **Identify the Key Tables and Columns**:    - From the `Business` table, we need the `business_id` and `city`.    - From the `Business_Attributes` table, we need the `attribute_value`.    - From the `Business_Categories` table, we need the `business_id` and `category_id`.    - From the `Categories` table, we need the `category_name`.  3. **Determine the Filtering Criteria**:    - We are interested in businesses located in Scottsdale, so we need to filter by `city = 'Scottsdale'`.    - We are also interested in businesses with a category of ""Fashion"", so we need to filter by `category_name = 'Fashion'`.  4. **Plan the Joins**:    - Start with the `Business` table to filter businesses located in Scottsdale.    - Join `Business_Categories` to link each business to its categories.    - Join `Categories` to filter businesses that fall under the ""Fashion"" category.    - Join `Business_Attributes` to retrieve the attribute values for these businesses.  5. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Use an INNER JOIN to connect the tables based on the relationships identified.    - Apply the WHERE clause to filter by city and category name.    - Select the `attribute_value` from the `Business_Attributes` table for the final output.  6. **Construct the Final Query**:        SELECT T2.attribute_value    FROM Business AS T1    INNER JOIN Business_Attributes AS T2 ON T1.business_id = T2.business_id    INNER JOIN Business_Categories AS T3 ON T1.business_id = T3.business_id    INNER JOIN Categories AS T4 ON T3.category_id = T4.category_id    WHERE T4.category_name LIKE 'Fashion'    AND T1.city LIKE 'Scottsdale';      By following these logical steps, we ensure that the query retrieves the desired information accurately and efficiently.",,

Here is a step-by-step logical approach to reach the solution:  1. **Understand the Problem:**    - We are tasked with finding the names of businesses located in Tempe city that open before 8 AM.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables:**    - **Business**: This table contains information about businesses, including their city, which is crucial for filtering businesses located in Tempe.    - **Business_Hours**: This table provides the opening and closing times for businesses, which is necessary to determine if they open before 8 AM.    - **Categories** and **Business_Categories**: These tables are needed to retrieve the business names (assuming the problem statement meant to retrieve business categories, as the solution provided retrieves category names).  3. **Determine Necessary Joins:**    - To connect the relevant tables, we need to perform the following joins:      - Join `Business` and `Business_Hours` on `business_id` to link business information with their operating hours.      - Join `Business` and `Business_Categories` on `business_id` to connect businesses with their categories.      - Join `Categories` and `Business_Categories` on `category_id` to retrieve the category names.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query:**    - Start with the `SELECT` statement to retrieve the desired information, which is the `category_name` from the `Categories` table.    - Use `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on the identified relationships.    - Apply the `WHERE` clause to filter businesses located in Tempe (`T3.city LIKE 'Tempe'`) and those that open before 8 AM (`T4.opening_time < '8AM'`).  5. **Write the SQL Query:**    - The final query is:            SELECT T1.category_name      FROM Categories AS T1      INNER JOIN Business_Categories AS T2 ON T1.category_id = T2.category_id      INNER JOIN Business AS T3 ON T2.business_id = T3.business_id      INNER JOIN Business_Hours AS T4 ON T3.business_id = T4.business_id      WHERE T3.city LIKE 'Tempe' AND T4.opening_time < '8AM'        6. **Verify the Solution:**    - Ensure that the query logic aligns with the problem requirements: filtering by city and opening time, and retrieving the correct information (category names).  By following these logical steps, we can construct a query that effectively solves the problem of identifying businesses in Tempe that open earlier than 8 AM.",,

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the logical reasoning process to arrive at the solution:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to find businesses in Glendale that are still operational and have specific opening and closing hours (8 AM to 6 PM).  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - **Business**: This table contains information about businesses, including their city and active status.    - **Business_Hours**: This table provides the opening and closing times for businesses.    - **Business_Categories** and **Categories**: These tables are used in the solution, but they are not strictly necessary for solving the problem as stated. However, they can be used to ensure we are counting distinct businesses.  3. **Filter Businesses by City and Active Status**:    - From the `Business` table, select businesses where `city` is 'Glendale' and `active` is true. This ensures we are only considering businesses that are currently operational in Glendale.  4. **Filter by Business Hours**:    - From the `Business_Hours` table, filter for businesses that open at '8AM' and close at '6PM'. This ensures we only consider businesses with the specified operating hours.  5. **Join Tables to Aggregate Data**:    - Join the `Business` table with the `Business_Hours` table on `business_id` to link business information with their operating hours.    - Although the solution uses `Categories` and `Business_Categories`, these are not necessary unless we are interested in specific categories. We can focus on counting distinct businesses.  6. **Count the Number of Businesses**:    - Use the `COUNT` function to count the number of distinct businesses that meet all the criteria (located in Glendale, active, and open from 8 AM to 6 PM).  7. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Based on the above steps, the SQL query is constructed to join the necessary tables, apply the filters, and count the businesses.  Here is the SQL query based on the logical reasoning:   SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT T3.business_id) FROM Business AS T3 INNER JOIN Business_Hours AS T4 ON T3.business_id = T4.business_id WHERE T3.city = 'Glendale'   AND T3.active = true   AND T4.opening_time = '8AM'   AND T4.closing_time = '6PM';   This query counts the number of distinct businesses in Glendale that are active and have the specified opening and closing times.",,

Here's how we can break down the process:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to find two things: the number of businesses located in Phoenix and the percentage of these businesses relative to the total number of businesses in all cities.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - The `Business` table is crucial as it contains information about businesses, including their `city`.    - We need the `business_id` to uniquely identify each business.    - The `city` column will help us filter businesses located in Phoenix.  3. **Determine the Necessary SQL Operations**:    - We need to filter businesses by the city name ""Phoenix"".    - Count the number of businesses in Phoenix.    - Calculate the total number of businesses across all cities.    - Compute the percentage of Phoenix businesses relative to the total.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Use a `SELECT` statement to retrieve the necessary data.    - Use `SUM` with a `CASE` statement to count businesses in Phoenix.    - Use `COUNT` to get the total number of businesses.    - Calculate the percentage by dividing the number of Phoenix businesses by the total and multiplying by 100.  5. **Consider Joins and Additional Tables**:    - The solution involves joining the `Business` table with `Business_Categories` and `Categories`. This might be necessary if we want to filter or categorize businesses further, but for the basic problem, the `Business` table alone suffices.  6. **Write the SQL Query**:    - The query uses a `CASE` statement within a `SUM` to count Phoenix businesses.    - The `CAST` function ensures the division results in a real number for percentage calculation.    - The query structure is as follows:   SELECT      SUM(CASE WHEN T3.city LIKE 'Phoenix' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS ""num"",     CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN T3.city LIKE 'Phoenix' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(T3.city) FROM      Business_Categories AS T1 INNER JOIN      Categories AS T2 ON T1.category_id = T2.category_id INNER JOIN      Business AS T3 ON T1.business_id = T3.business_id;   7. **Verify and Validate**:    - Ensure the query correctly counts businesses in Phoenix.    - Validate the percentage calculation by checking it against known data or expected results.  By following these steps, we logically derive the solution to the problem using the given schema and SQL operations.",,

Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the logical steps that could have been taken to reach the solution:  1. **Understand the Schema and Problem Requirements**:     - We need to work with the `Business_Categories`, `Categories`, and `Business` tables.    - Our goal is to find cities with businesses categorized under ""Active Life"" and calculate the percentage of cities with low review counts.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - From the `Categories` table, we need the `category_id` and `category_name` to identify the ""Active Life"" category.    - The `Business_Categories` table links businesses to categories via `business_id` and `category_id`.    - The `Business` table provides `city`, `review_count`, and `business_id` to filter and calculate the required metrics.  3. **Join Tables to Access Necessary Data**:    - Perform an INNER JOIN between `Business_Categories` and `Categories` on `category_id` to filter businesses that fall under the ""Active Life"" category.    - Join the resulting table with `Business` on `business_id` to access city and review count information.  4. **Filter for ""Active Life"" Category**:    - Use a CASE statement to count businesses that have the ""Active Life"" category. This is done by checking if `category_name` is ""Active Life"".  5. **Calculate the Percentage of Cities with Low Review Counts**:    - Use another CASE statement to identify businesses in a specific city (e.g., Phoenix) and count them.    - Calculate the total number of businesses with low review counts by filtering `review_count` for ""Low"".  6. **Compute the Percentage**:    - Divide the count of businesses in the specified city by the total number of businesses with low review counts.    - Multiply by 100 to convert this ratio into a percentage.  7. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Construct the SQL query using the identified logic and operations, ensuring to handle data types correctly (e.g., casting to REAL for percentage calculation).  8. **Verify and Optimize**:    - Ensure the query accurately reflects the problem requirements and is optimized for performance, considering the use of indexes and efficient joins.  By following these logical steps, we can systematically approach the problem and construct a solution that meets the requirements. The final SQL query effectively combines these elements to provide the desired output.",,

Here's how you might approach the problem:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to find the number of businesses that are both located in Phoenix and are currently active.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - From the schema provided, the `Business` table is the most relevant because it contains information about businesses, including their location (`city`) and their status (`active`).  3. **Determine Necessary Conditions**:    - We need to filter businesses based on two conditions:      1. The business is located in Phoenix (`city` column).      2. The business is active (`active` column).  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - We need to count the number of businesses that meet both conditions. This can be done using a `SELECT` statement with a `COUNT` function and a `WHERE` clause to apply the filters.  5. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Start with the `SELECT` statement to count the `business_id`, which uniquely identifies each business.    - Use the `FROM` clause to specify the `Business` table.    - Use the `WHERE` clause to filter the rows where `city` is 'Phoenix' and `active` is 'TRUE'.  6. **Consider SQL Syntax and Data Types**:    - Ensure that string comparisons are case-insensitive and handle any potential whitespace issues by using `LIKE` instead of `=` for string comparison.  7. **Write the Final Query**:    - The final SQL query is:            SELECT COUNT(business_id)       FROM Business       WHERE city LIKE 'Phoenix' AND active LIKE 'TRUE';        8. **Review and Validate**:    - Double-check the query logic to ensure it accurately reflects the problem requirements.    - Consider edge cases, such as businesses with similar names or inactive businesses, to ensure they are correctly excluded.  By following these logical steps, you ensure a systematic approach to solving the problem and constructing a valid SQL query.",,

Here's how one might approach the problem:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement:**    - We need to find the number of businesses in Scottsdale that are rated as a ""wonderful experience.""    - The term ""wonderful experience"" is subjective, but in the context of ratings, it typically implies a high rating. We will assume it means businesses with a rating above 3 stars.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns:**    - The `Business` table is relevant because it contains information about businesses, including their location (`city`) and their ratings (`stars`).  3. **Determine the Criteria for ""Wonderful Experience"":**    - Based on the assumption that ""wonderful experience"" corresponds to a high rating, we decide to use a threshold of greater than 3 stars.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query:**    - We need to count the number of businesses that meet the criteria of being located in Scottsdale and having a rating greater than 3 stars.    - The SQL query will filter businesses by the `city` column and the `stars` column.  5. **Construct the SQL Query:**    - Use the `SELECT` statement to count the number of businesses.    - Use the `WHERE` clause to filter businesses located in Scottsdale and with a rating greater than 3 stars.    - The query will look like this:            SELECT COUNT(business_id)       FROM Business       WHERE city LIKE 'Scottsdale' AND stars > 3;        6. **Verify the Query:**    - Ensure that the query correctly counts the number of businesses that meet the specified criteria.    - Check for any potential issues, such as case sensitivity in the city name or edge cases with star ratings.  By following these steps, we logically arrive at the solution to the problem, ensuring that we have considered the necessary criteria and used the appropriate SQL syntax to achieve the desired result.",,

This involves summing the `stars` values and dividing by the count of inactive businesses.  5. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - **Select Clause**: We need to select the average rating.

Here's how you can break down the problem and arrive at the solution:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to list all business IDs in Mesa city where the review stars are over 3.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**:    - The `Business` table contains information about businesses, including their IDs and city.    - The `Reviews` table contains information about reviews, including business IDs and review stars.  3. **Determine Necessary Columns**:    - From the `Business` table, we need the `business_id` and `city` columns to filter businesses located in Mesa.    - From the `Reviews` table, we need the `business_id` and `review_stars` columns to filter reviews with stars greater than 3.  4. **Establish Relationships Between Tables**:    - The `business_id` column is common between the `Business` and `Reviews` tables, allowing us to join these tables.  5. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Use an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Business` and `Reviews` tables on the `business_id` column. This will allow us to access both business location and review stars in a single query.    - Apply a `WHERE` clause to filter businesses located in Mesa (`T1.city LIKE 'Mesa'`).    - Further filter the results to only include reviews with more than 3 stars (`T2.review_stars > 3`).  6. **Group and Select the Required Data**:    - Use `GROUP BY T1.business_id` to ensure each business ID is listed only once, even if there are multiple reviews meeting the criteria.    - Use `SELECT T1.business_id` to retrieve the list of business IDs that meet all the conditions.  By following these logical steps, we can construct the SQL query that effectively solves the problem:   SELECT T1.business_id  FROM Business AS T1  INNER JOIN Reviews AS T2  ON T1.business_id = T2.business_id  WHERE T1.city LIKE 'Mesa'  AND T2.review_stars > 3  GROUP BY T1.business_id;   This query efficiently retrieves all business IDs in Mesa city with review stars greater than 3, as required by the problem statement.",,

This requires us to focus on businesses and their associated reviews.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - The `Business` table contains information about businesses, including their city.    - The `Reviews` table contains information about reviews, including the number of funny votes.  3. **Determine the Relationship Between Tables**:    - The `Business` table and the `Reviews` table can be linked through the `business_id` column, which is common to both tables.  4. **Filter Reviews with Low Funny Votes**:    - We need to filter the reviews to only include those where the `review_votes_funny` column is marked as ""low"". This will help us focus on businesses that have low funny votes.  5. **Join Tables**:    - Perform an INNER JOIN between the `Business` table and the `Reviews` table on the `business_id` column to combine business information with their respective reviews.  6. **Group by City**:    - Once we have the relevant data, group the results by the `city` column from the `Business` table. This will allow us to count the number of businesses with low funny votes in each city.  7. **Count Businesses per City**:    - Use the COUNT function to determine the number of businesses in each city that have reviews with low funny votes.  8. **Identify the City with the Least Number of Such Businesses**:    - Order the results by the count in ascending order and limit the result to the top entry to find the city with the least number of businesses having low funny votes.  9. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Based on the above steps, the SQL query would be:            SELECT T1.city      FROM Business AS T1      INNER JOIN Reviews AS T2 ON T1.business_id = T2.business_id      WHERE T2.review_votes_funny LIKE 'low'      GROUP BY T1.city      ORDER BY COUNT(T1.business_id) ASC      LIMIT 1;        By following these steps, we can logically derive the solution to the problem, ensuring that we correctly identify the city with the least number of businesses that have low funny votes.",,

Here's how we can approach the problem:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to find the percentage of businesses in Chandler that are in the Real Estate sector and have a 5-star rating. This involves filtering businesses based on location, category, and rating.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - The `Business` table contains information about businesses, including their location (`city`) and their rating (`stars`).    - The `Business_Categories` table links businesses to their categories via `business_id` and `category_id`.    - The `Categories` table contains the names of categories, which we need to filter for ""Real Estate"".  3. **Filter Businesses by Location**:    - We need to select businesses located in Chandler. This can be done by filtering the `city` column in the `Business` table.  4. **Join Tables to Access Category Information**:    - To determine if a business is in the Real Estate sector, we need to join the `Business` table with the `Business_Categories` table on `business_id`.    - Then, join the result with the `Categories` table on `category_id` to access the `category_name`.  5. **Filter by Category**:    - Once we have joined the tables, filter the results to include only those businesses whose `category_name` is ""Real Estate"".  6. **Filter by Rating**:    - Further filter the results to include only businesses with a 5-star rating. This involves checking the `stars` column in the `Business` table.  7. **Calculate the Percentage**:    - Calculate the total number of businesses in Chandler that are in the Real Estate sector and have a 5-star rating.    - Calculate the total number of businesses in Chandler that are in the Real Estate sector, regardless of their rating.    - Use these two numbers to calculate the percentage:       \[      \text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{\text{Number of 5-star Real Estate businesses}}{\text{Total number of Real Estate businesses}}\right) \times 100      \]  8. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Use SQL to implement the above logic. The query should join the necessary tables, apply the filters, and calculate the percentage using aggregate functions like `SUM` and `COUNT`.  Here is the SQL query that implements these steps:   SELECT    CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN T1.stars = 5 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(T1.business_id) AS ""percentage""  FROM    Business AS T1  INNER JOIN    Business_Categories ON T1.business_id = Business_Categories.business_id  INNER JOIN    Categories AS T3 ON Business_Categories.category_id = T3.category_id  WHERE    T1.city LIKE 'Chandler'    AND T3.category_name LIKE 'Real Estate';   This query calculates the percentage of Real Estate businesses in Chandler with a 5-star rating by filtering, joining, and aggregating the necessary data.",,

In this case, it's the `Users` table.    - Check the columns in the `Users` table to find relevant data:      - `user_yelping_since_year`: This column indicates the year the user started yelping.      - `user_votes_funny`: This column indicates the number of funny votes a user has received.  3. **Filter Users by Year**:    - We need to filter the users who started yelping in the year 2012. This can be done using the condition `user_yelping_since_year = 2012`.  4. **Filter Users by Funny Votes**:    - We are interested in users with a high number of funny votes. Assuming the column `user_votes_funny` contains qualitative data (e.g., Low, Medium, High), we need to filter users where `user_votes_funny` is 'High'.  5. **Count the Filtered Users**:    - After applying the filters for the year and funny votes, we need to count the number of users that meet these criteria.  6. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Combine the above steps into a SQL query:            SELECT COUNT(user_id)       FROM Users       WHERE user_yelping_since_year = 2012       AND user_votes_funny LIKE 'High';          - This query selects the count of `user_id` from the `Users` table where the conditions for the year and funny votes are met.  7. **Verify the Solution**:    - Ensure that the query correctly reflects the problem requirements and that the schema supports the query logic.    - Double-check that the `user_votes_funny` column is indeed qualitative and can be filtered using the `LIKE` operator.  By following these steps, we can logically arrive at the solution to the SQL problem.",,

This means we need to look for attributes whose names suggest a relation to payment.  2. **Review the Schema**: Examine the provided schema to identify where attributes are stored. The relevant table is `Attributes`, which contains columns `attribute_id` and `attribute_name`.  3. **Identify Relevant Data**: Focus on the `Attributes` table since it holds the data about different attributes, including their IDs and names. We need to find attribute names that relate to payment.  4. **Determine the Search Criteria**: Since we are looking for attributes related to payment, consider using a pattern matching technique to identify relevant attribute names. The keyword ""payment"" is a logical choice for this search.  5. **Formulate the SQL Query**: Use the SQL `SELECT` statement to retrieve `attribute_id` from the `Attributes` table where `attribute_name` contains the word ""payment"". The `LIKE` operator is suitable for this purpose, and the pattern `'%payment%'` will match any attribute name containing the word ""payment"".  6. **Construct the SQL Query**: Based on the above reasoning, the SQL query should be:        SELECT attribute_id FROM Attributes WHERE attribute_name LIKE '%payment%'      7. **Execute and Validate**: Execute the query on the database to retrieve the attribute IDs.

The `Reviews` table contains this column, along with `business_id` and `user_id`, which are necessary for filtering the correct review.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - **Select Clause**: We want to select the `review_length` column since that is the information we need.    - **From Clause**: The data is located in the `Reviews` table.    - **Where Clause**: We need to filter the data to find the specific review. The conditions are:      - `user_id = 612`: To ensure we are looking at reviews written by the correct user.      - `business_id = 2`: To ensure we are looking at reviews for the correct business.  5. **Consider Additional Conditions**: The problem statement does not specify any additional conditions like review stars or votes, but if there were any such conditions, they would be added to the `WHERE` clause.  6. **Write the SQL Query**: Combine the above elements to form the SQL query:        SELECT review_length FROM Reviews WHERE user_id = 612 AND business_id = 2;      7. **Verify the Query**: Ensure that the query correctly captures the problem requirements and that it will return the correct data from the database.  8. **Execute and Interpret Results**: Run the query on the database to get the `review_length` for the specified review.

This requires identifying businesses that are both located in Gilbert and marked as active.  2. **Review the Schema**: Examine the provided schema to identify where relevant information is stored. The `Business` table contains columns such as `business_id`, `active`, `city`, and other business-related attributes.  3. **Identify Relevant Columns**: From the `Business` table, focus on the `city` and `active` columns. The `city` column will help us filter businesses located in Gilbert, and the `active` column will help us filter businesses that are currently operational.  4. **Formulate the Query**:    - **Filter by City**: Use the `city` column to select only those businesses located in Gilbert. This can be done using a `WHERE` clause with a condition like `city LIKE 'Gilbert'`.    - **Filter by Active Status**: Further refine the selection by ensuring that only active businesses are considered. This can be achieved by adding another condition to the `WHERE` clause: `active LIKE 'True'`.  5. **Count the Results**: Since the problem asks for the number of such businesses, use the `COUNT` function to count the number of `business_id` entries that meet both conditions.  6. **Construct the SQL Query**: Combine the above steps into a single SQL query:        SELECT COUNT(business_id)     FROM Business     WHERE city LIKE 'Gilbert' AND active LIKE 'True';      7. **Verify the Solution**: Ensure that the query correctly reflects the problem statement and that it will return the desired count of active businesses in Gilbert City.

The term ""low-quality reviews"" needs to be defined in terms of the available data.  2. **Review the Schema**:    - Examine the schema to identify which tables and columns might be relevant to the problem. The `Business` table contains information about businesses, including their location (`state`) and a column (`review_count`) that might indicate the quality of reviews.  3. **Identify Relevant Columns**:    - From the `Business` table, the `state` column will help us filter businesses located in Arizona. The `review_count` column, which is described with qualitative values such as ""Low"", ""Medium"", etc., can be used to identify businesses with low-quality reviews.  4. **Define ""Low Quality of Reviews""**:    - Based on the schema, ""low quality of reviews"" can be interpreted as businesses with a `review_count` labeled as ""Low"". This is an assumption based on the available data and the problem context.  5. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Construct a SQL query that selects businesses in Arizona (`state = 'AZ'`) and have a `review_count` labeled as ""Low"".

Here are the logical steps that could have been taken to reach the solution:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to find business numbers in Arizona that have received 5-star reviews.    - We are required to list any three such business numbers.  2. **Analyze the Schema**:    - The `Business` table contains information about businesses, including their `business_id`, `state`, and `stars`.    - The `Reviews` table contains reviews for businesses, including `business_id` and `review_stars`.  3. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - From the `Business` table, we need the `business_id` and `state` columns to filter businesses located in Arizona.    - From the `Reviews` table, we need the `business_id` and `review_stars` columns to identify businesses with 5-star reviews.  4. **Determine the Relationships**:    - The `business_id` column is the common key between the `Business` and `Reviews` tables, allowing us to join these tables.  5. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Use an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Reviews` and `Business` tables based on the `business_id`.    - Filter the results to include only those businesses located in Arizona (`state = 'AZ'`).    - Further filter the results to include only reviews with 5 stars (`review_stars = 5`).  6. **Select the Required Output**:    - Use `SELECT DISTINCT` to ensure each business number is listed only once, even if it has multiple 5-star reviews.    - Limit the output to any three business numbers using `LIMIT 3`.  7. **Construct the Final Query**:    - The final SQL query is:            SELECT DISTINCT T2.business_id      FROM Reviews AS T1      INNER JOIN Business AS T2 ON T1.business_id = T2.business_id      WHERE T2.state LIKE 'AZ' AND T1.review_stars = 5      LIMIT 3;        By following these logical steps, we can systematically arrive at the solution to the problem, ensuring that the query meets all the specified requirements.",,

This implies that we are looking for attributes associated with business number 2 that have a specific value indicating absence, such as 'none'.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**: From the schema, the tables of interest are `Attributes` and `Business_Attributes`. The `Attributes` table contains the list of all possible attributes, and the `Business_Attributes` table links these attributes to specific businesses along with their values.  3. **Analyze the `Business_Attributes` Table**: This table contains `attribute_id`, `business_id`, and `attribute_value`. We need to filter this table to find entries where `business_id` is 2 and `attribute_value` is 'none', indicating that the business does not have these attributes.  4. **Join Tables to Get Attribute Names**: To get the names of the attributes that business number 2 does not have, we need to join the `Business_Attributes` table with the `Attributes` table. The join should be on the `attribute_id` column, which is common to both tables.  5. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Start by selecting the `attribute_name` from the `Attributes` table.    - Perform an INNER JOIN between `Attributes` and `Business_Attributes` on `attribute_id`.    - Add a WHERE clause to filter records where `business_id` is 2 and `attribute_value` is 'none'.    - Use `LIMIT 1` to return just one attribute name, as the problem asks for one attribute.  6. **Verify the Solution**: Ensure that the query correctly identifies an attribute that business number 2 does not have by checking the logic and the tables involved.  By following these steps, we derive the solution:   SELECT T1.attribute_name  FROM Attributes AS T1  INNER JOIN Business_Attributes AS T2  ON T1.attribute_id = T2.attribute_id  WHERE T2.business_id = 2 AND T2.attribute_value LIKE 'none'  LIMIT 1;   This query effectively finds an attribute that business number 2 lacks by filtering and joining the relevant tables.",,

From the schema, the relevant tables are `Users_Compliments` and `Compliments`.    - `Users_Compliments` contains information about the number of compliments each user received, with columns `compliment_id`, `user_id`, and `number_of_compliments`.    - `Compliments` contains the types of compliments, with columns `compliment_id` and `compliment_type`.  3. **Determine the Relationship Between Tables**:    - The `Users_Compliments` table links users to compliments via `compliment_id`.    - The `Compliments` table provides the type of each compliment, also using `compliment_id`.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - We need to join the `Users_Compliments` table with the `Compliments` table to access the `compliment_type` for each `compliment_id`.    - Use an INNER JOIN on `compliment_id` to combine these tables.  5. **Filter the Data**:    - We are only interested in compliments received by user_id 33, so filter the results where `user_id = 33`.    - Additionally, we need to filter for compliments of type ""cool"", so include a condition where `compliment_type = 'cool'`.  6. **Count the Results**:    - Use the COUNT function to determine the number of ""cool"" compliments received by user 33.  7. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Combine all the above logic into a single SQL query:            SELECT COUNT(T2.compliment_type)       FROM Users_Compliments AS T1       INNER JOIN Compliments AS T2       ON T1.compliment_id = T2.compliment_id       WHERE T1.user_id = 33       AND T2.compliment_type LIKE 'cool';        8. **Review and Validate**:    - Ensure that the query correctly joins the tables and applies the necessary filters.    - Validate the query logic against the schema to confirm that it will return the correct count of ""cool"" compliments for user 33.  By following these logical steps, we can systematically arrive at the solution to the SQL problem.",,

This allows us to match business hours to specific days of the week.  4. **Formulate the Query**:    - We need to select the opening and closing times for business number 53 on Friday.    - Use an INNER JOIN to combine `Business_Hours` and `Days` tables on the `day_id` column to filter for Friday.    - Filter the results to only include records where `business_id` is 53 and `day_of_week` is Friday.  5. **Calculate Opening Hours**:    - Once we have the opening and closing times for the specified day and business, calculate the difference between `closing_time` and `opening_time` to determine the total opening hours.  6. **Write the SQL Query**:    - The SQL query would look like this:            SELECT T1.closing_time - T1.opening_time AS ""opening hours""      FROM Business_Hours AS T1      INNER JOIN Days AS T2 ON T1.day_id = T2.day_id      WHERE T2.day_of_week LIKE 'Friday' AND T1.business_id = 53;        7. **Verify the Solution**:    - Ensure that the query correctly calculates the opening hours by checking if the `closing_time` and `opening_time` are in the correct format for subtraction.    - Verify that the query filters correctly for business number 53 and the day Friday.

This requires identifying the relevant tables and columns that can provide this information.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**: From the schema provided, the tables of interest are:    - `Business_Categories`: This table links businesses to categories through `business_id` and `category_id`.    - `Categories`: This table provides the names of the categories through `category_id` and `category_name`.  3. **Determine Necessary Columns**:    - From `Business_Categories`, you need `business_id` to filter for business number 15 and `category_id` to identify the categories it belongs to.    - From `Categories`, you need `category_name` to get the human-readable names of the categories.  4. **Establish Table Relationships**:     - The `Business_Categories` table contains `category_id`, which can be used to join with the `Categories` table on the same column to retrieve the category names.  5. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Start by selecting the `category_name` from the `Categories` table.    - Use an INNER JOIN to connect `Business_Categories` and `Categories` on `category_id`.    - Apply a WHERE clause to filter records where `business_id` is 15.  6. **Write the SQL Query**:    - The SQL query that encapsulates the above logic is:            SELECT T2.category_name       FROM Business_Categories AS T1       INNER JOIN Categories AS T2       ON T1.category_id = T2.category_id       WHERE T1.business_id = 15;        7. **Verify the Solution**:    - Ensure that the query correctly retrieves the category names for business number 15 by checking the logic of joins and filters.    - Confirm that the query only selects the necessary columns and tables, optimizing for performance and clarity.  By following these steps, you logically deduce the solution to the problem using the given database schema and relationships between tables.",,

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logical reasoning to arrive at the solution:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement:**    - We need to find user numbers with a specific quantity (""Uber"") of a specific type (""cute"") of compliments.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables:**    - From the schema, the `Users_Compliments` table contains information about the number of compliments each user has received.    - The `Compliments` table contains the types of compliments.  3. **Determine Key Columns:**    - In `Users_Compliments`, the relevant columns are `user_id`, `compliment_id`, and `number_of_compliments`.    - In `Compliments`, the relevant columns are `compliment_id` and `compliment_type`.  4. **Establish Table Relationships:**    - The `compliment_id` column is common between `Users_Compliments` and `Compliments`, allowing us to join these tables to filter the data based on the type of compliment.  5. **Formulate the SQL Query:**    - **Join the Tables:** Use an INNER JOIN to combine `Users_Compliments` and `Compliments` on the `compliment_id` column.    - **Filter for ""Uber"" Compliments:** In the `Users_Compliments` table, filter for rows where `number_of_compliments` is ""Uber"".    - **Filter for ""Cute"" Compliments:** In the `Compliments` table, filter for rows where `compliment_type` is ""cute"".    - **Select User IDs:** From the filtered results, select the `user_id` column.    - **Limit the Results:** Since the problem asks for any two user numbers, use `LIMIT 2` to restrict the output to two user IDs.  6. **Write the SQL Query:**    - The SQL query is formulated as follows:            SELECT T1.user_id      FROM Users_Compliments AS T1      INNER JOIN Compliments AS T2 ON T1.compliment_id = T2.compliment_id      WHERE T1.number_of_compliments LIKE 'Uber'      AND T2.compliment_type LIKE 'cute'      LIMIT 2;        7. **Verify the Query:**    - Ensure that the query logic aligns with the problem requirements, and the correct tables and columns are used for filtering and joining.  By following these logical steps, we can systematically approach the problem and construct a query that meets the specified requirements.",,

The solution involves several logical steps:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: We need to find businesses in the ""Accessories"" category that have received positive reviews, specifically those that can be considered a ""wonderful experience"". This typically means reviews with more than 3 stars.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - **Categories**: Contains `category_id` and `category_name`. We need this to find the ""Accessories"" category.    - **Business_Categories**: Contains `business_id` and `category_id`. This table links businesses to their categories.    - **Business**: Contains `business_id`, `stars`, and other business details. We need this to filter businesses based on their star ratings.  3. **Establish Relationships Between Tables**:    - Use the `Categories` table to find the `category_id` for ""Accessories"".    - Use the `Business_Categories` table to find `business_id`s that are associated with the ""Accessories"" `category_id`.    - Use the `Business` table to filter these businesses based on their star ratings.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Start by selecting the `category_id` for ""Accessories"" from the `Categories` table.    - Join the `Business_Categories` table on `category_id` to get all `business_id`s associated with ""Accessories"".    - Join the `Business` table on `business_id` to access the star ratings.    - Apply a filter to select businesses with a star rating greater than 3, which indicates a ""wonderful experience"".  5. **Count the Number of Businesses**:    - Use the `COUNT()` function to count the number of `business_id`s that meet the criteria.  6. **Write the Final SQL Query**:    - Combine the above steps into a single SQL query:            SELECT COUNT(T2.business_id)      FROM Categories AS T1      INNER JOIN Business_Categories AS T2 ON T1.category_id = T2.category_id      INNER JOIN Business AS T3 ON T2.business_id = T3.business_id      WHERE T3.stars > 3 AND T1.category_name LIKE 'Accessories'        By following these logical steps, we can systematically approach the problem and construct a query that accurately counts the number of businesses in the ""Accessories"" category that have received reviews indicative of a ""wonderful experience"".",,

This will allow us to associate each business with its corresponding hours of operation.    - **Apply Filters**:      - Filter for `business_id = 12` to focus on the specific business.      - Filter for `city = 'Scottsdale'` to ensure the business is located in Scottsdale.      - Filter for `day_id = 3` to get the hours of operation for the specified day.    - **Calculate the Duration**: Subtract the `opening_time` from the `closing_time` to calculate how long the business stays open on that day.  5. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Based on the above logic, the SQL query would be:            SELECT T2.closing_time - T2.opening_time AS ""hour""      FROM Business AS T1      INNER JOIN Business_Hours AS T2 ON T1.business_id = T2.business_id      WHERE T1.business_id = 12      AND T1.city LIKE 'Scottsdale'      AND T2.day_id = 3;        6. **Verify the Solution**:    - Ensure that the query correctly joins the tables and applies the necessary filters.    - Check that the calculation of the duration is accurate and reflects the business hours for the specified day.

Here's how we can approach the problem:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement:**    - We need to count businesses in Arizona that do not open on Thursday.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables:**    - The `Business` table contains information about businesses, including their state.    - The `Checkins` table provides data on business activity by day and time, which can help determine if a business is open on a specific day.    - The `Days` table maps day IDs to actual days of the week.  3. **Determine Necessary Joins:**    - To determine if a business is open on Thursday, we need to join the `Checkins` table with the `Days` table to filter for Thursday.    - We also need to join the `Checkins` table with the `Business` table to filter businesses located in Arizona.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query:**    - Start by selecting the `business_id` from the `Business` table.    - Join the `Business` table with the `Checkins` table on `business_id` to get check-in data.    - Join the `Checkins` table with the `Days` table on `day_id` to filter for Thursday.    - Use a `WHERE` clause to filter businesses located in Arizona (`state = 'AZ'`) and those that do not open on Thursday (`label_time_4 = 'None'`).  5. **Count the Results:**    - Use the `COUNT` function to count the number of unique `business_id`s that meet the criteria.  6. **Write the SQL Query:**    - The final SQL query is:            SELECT COUNT(T1.business_id)      FROM Business AS T1      INNER JOIN Checkins AS T2 ON T1.business_id = T2.business_id      INNER JOIN Days AS T3 ON T2.day_id = T3.day_id      WHERE T2.label_time_4 LIKE 'None'      AND T1.state LIKE 'AZ'      AND T3.day_of_week LIKE 'Thursday'        7. **Verify the Logic:**    - Ensure that the query logic aligns with the problem statement: counting businesses in Arizona that do not open on Thursday.    - Double-check the join conditions and `WHERE` clause filters to ensure they accurately reflect the requirements.  By following these logical steps, we ensure a systematic approach to solving the SQL problem using the given schema.",,

This involves identifying the relevant table and columns that contain information about businesses and their locations.  2. **Identify the Relevant Table**: From the given schema, the `Business` table is the most relevant because it contains information about businesses, including their `business_id`, `city`, and other attributes.  3. **Locate the City Information**: Within the `Business` table, identify the column that specifies the city in which each business is located. This is the `city` column.  4. **Formulate the Query**:    - We need to count the number of businesses where the city is Scottsdale. This translates to a SQL query that filters businesses based on the `city` column.    - Use the `COUNT()` function to count the number of businesses that meet the criteria.  5. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Use the `SELECT` statement to specify what we want to retrieve, which is the count of `business_id`.    - Use the `FROM` clause to specify the table we are querying, which is `Business`.    - Use the `WHERE` clause to filter the rows where the `city` column matches 'Scottsdale'.  6. **Consider Case Sensitivity and Variations**: Since city names might vary in case or have trailing spaces, use the `LIKE` operator for a more flexible match. However, in this case, the city name is straightforward, so `=` could also work if case sensitivity is not an issue.  7. **Final SQL Query**:    - The query becomes: `SELECT COUNT(business_id) FROM Business WHERE city LIKE 'Scottsdale'`.  By following these steps, we ensure that we accurately count the number of businesses located in Scottsdale using the provided schema and data.",,

This means we need to filter businesses based on their location (Arizona) and their status (active).  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns:**    - From the schema provided, the `Business` table contains information about businesses, including their location (`state`), operational status (`active`), and a unique identifier (`business_id`).  3. **Determine the Necessary Conditions:**    - We need to filter businesses that are located in Arizona. This can be done by checking the `state` column for the value 'AZ'.    - We also need to ensure that the businesses are still operational. This can be verified by checking the `active` column for the value 'True'.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query:**    - We need to count the number of businesses that meet both conditions: located in Arizona and active.    - The SQL query should select the count of `business_id` from the `Business` table where the `state` is 'AZ' and `active` is 'True'.  5. **Write the SQL Query:**    - The query can be constructed as follows:            SELECT COUNT(business_id)       FROM Business       WHERE state LIKE 'AZ' AND active LIKE 'True';        6. **Verify the Logic:**    - Ensure that the query correctly filters businesses based on the specified conditions and counts the number of such businesses.    - The use of `LIKE` is appropriate for string comparison in SQL, and it ensures that the filter conditions are applied correctly.

Here's how we can break down the process:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to find the number of businesses in Scottsdale that have received positive comments in the Elitestar rating. In this context, ""positive comments"" can be inferred as businesses with a higher star rating.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - From the schema provided, the `Business` table contains information about businesses, including their location (`city`) and their star ratings (`stars`).  3. **Define ""Positive Comments""**:    - Since the problem refers to ""positive comments in the Elitestar rating,"" we interpret this as businesses with a star rating greater than 3. This assumption is based on the common understanding that ratings above 3 are generally considered positive.  4. **Filter Businesses by Location**:    - We need to filter the businesses located in Scottsdale. This can be done by using the `city` column in the `Business` table and applying a condition to select only those businesses where `city` is 'Scottsdale'.  5. **Filter Businesses by Star Rating**:    - After filtering by location, we further filter the businesses to include only those with a star rating greater than 3. This is done using the `stars` column in the `Business` table.  6. **Count the Filtered Businesses**:    - Once we have the filtered list of businesses that meet both criteria (located in Scottsdale and having a star rating greater than 3), we need to count these businesses. This can be achieved using the `COUNT` function in SQL.  7. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Combine the above steps into a SQL query:            SELECT COUNT(business_id)       FROM Business       WHERE city LIKE 'Scottsdale' AND stars > 3;          - This query selects and counts the number of businesses in Scottsdale with a star rating greater than 3.  8. **Verify the Solution**:    - Double-check the logic and the SQL query to ensure that it correctly implements the problem requirements and assumptions.  By following these steps, we logically arrive at the solution to the problem using the provided schema and understanding of the context.",,

Here's how you might approach the problem:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: We need to compare two cities, Scottsdale and Anthem, based on the appeal of their Yelp businesses. ""Appealing to users"" needs to be defined in terms of available data.  2. **Identify Relevant Data**: From the schema, the `Business` table is the most relevant because it contains information about businesses, including their city, star ratings, and review counts. These factors can be indicators of a business's appeal.  3. **Define ""Appealing""**: In the context of Yelp, businesses that are appealing to users typically have higher star ratings and more reviews. Therefore, we can use the `stars` and `review_count` columns as metrics for appeal.  4. **Filter Data for Relevant Cities**: We need to focus on businesses located in Scottsdale and Anthem. This involves filtering the `Business` table to include only rows where the `city` column is either ""Scottsdale"" or ""Anthem"".  5. **Aggregate Data by City**: To compare the two cities, we need to aggregate the data. We can calculate the average star rating and the total review count for businesses in each city. This will give us a sense of the overall appeal of businesses in each city.  6. **Compare Cities**: With the aggregated data, compare the two cities based on the metrics defined. You might look at which city has a higher average star rating or a higher total review count.  7. **Formulate the SQL Query**: Based on the above steps, the SQL query should:    - Select the city and aggregate metrics (e.g., average stars, total review count).    - Filter for Scottsdale and Anthem.    - Order the results to determine which city has higher metrics.    - Limit the results to the top city based on the chosen metric.  8. **Write the SQL Query**:        SELECT city    FROM Business    WHERE city IN ('Scottsdale', 'Anthem')    GROUP BY city    ORDER BY SUM(review_count) DESC    LIMIT 1;        This query selects the city with the highest total review count among Scottsdale and Anthem, assuming that a higher review count indicates more user engagement and appeal.  9. **Interpret the Results**: The result will show which city has more Yelp businesses that are appealing to users based on the chosen metric (total review count in this case).  By following these steps, you can logically determine which city has more appealing Yelp businesses according to the available data.",,

This involves filtering businesses based on their location and their star rating.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:     - From the schema, identify the table that contains information about businesses. The `Business` table is relevant here.    - Identify the columns in the `Business` table that are necessary for solving the problem:      - `state`: to filter businesses located in Arizona.      - `stars`: to filter businesses with a star rating greater than 4.      - `business_id`: to count the number of businesses that meet the criteria.  3. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Start with the `SELECT` statement to specify what you want to retrieve. In this case, we want to count the number of businesses, so use `SELECT COUNT(business_id)`.    - Use the `FROM` clause to specify the table to query, which is `Business`.    - Use the `WHERE` clause to filter the data based on the conditions:      - `state LIKE 'AZ'`: to select businesses located in Arizona.      - `stars > 4`: to select businesses with a star rating greater than 4.  4. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Combine the above elements into a complete SQL query:            SELECT COUNT(business_id)       FROM Business       WHERE state LIKE 'AZ' AND stars > 4        5. **Review and Validate**:    - Ensure the query correctly reflects the problem statement.    - Validate the query logic by considering the schema and the problem requirements.

The `Reviews` table is relevant because it contains columns related to user IDs and reviews.  3. **Examine the `Reviews` Table**: Look at the columns in the `Reviews` table:    - `business_id`: Identifies the business being reviewed.    - `user_id`: Identifies the user who posted the review.    - `review_stars`: Indicates the star rating given in the review.    - `review_votes_funny`, `review_votes_useful`, `review_votes_cool`: Indicate votes on the review.    - `review_length`: Indicates the length of the review.  4. **Determine the Criteria for Counting**: Since the problem asks for the number of reviews by a specific user, focus on the `user_id` column to filter reviews by the user with ID 3.  5. **Formulate the SQL Query**:     - Use the `SELECT` statement to specify what you want to retrieve. In this case, you want to count the reviews, so use `COUNT()`.    - Use the `FROM` clause to specify the table, which is `Reviews`.    - Use the `WHERE` clause to filter the records to only those where `user_id` is 3.  6. **Construct the SQL Query**: Based on the above understanding, construct the SQL query:        SELECT COUNT(review_length) FROM Reviews WHERE user_id = 3;        - `COUNT(review_length)`: Counts the number of reviews. Using `review_length` ensures that only non-null reviews are counted.    - `FROM Reviews`: Specifies the table to query.    - `WHERE user_id = 3`: Filters the reviews to only those posted by the user with ID 3.  7. **Verify the Query**: Ensure the query correctly filters and counts the reviews for the specified user. The query should return the total number of reviews posted by user ID 3.  By following these steps, you logically arrive at the solution to the problem, ensuring that you correctly interpret the schema and construct an appropriate SQL query.",,

Here are the logical steps to reach the solution:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to focus on reviews made by a specific user (user ID 3).    - We are interested in reviews that are categorized as ""Long"".    - Among these long reviews, we need to count how many have received a ""Medium"" number of useful votes.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - The `Reviews` table contains the necessary information: `user_id`, `review_length`, and `review_votes_useful`.    - We do not need to join any other tables since all required data is in the `Reviews` table.  3. **Filter Reviews by User ID**:    - We need to filter the reviews to include only those made by user ID 3. This can be done using a `WHERE` clause: `WHERE user_id = 3`.  4. **Filter Reviews by Length**:    - We are only interested in reviews that are categorized as ""Long"". Add another condition to the `WHERE` clause: `AND review_length LIKE 'Long'`.  5. **Filter Reviews by Useful Votes**:    - We need to further filter these long reviews to include only those that have received a ""Medium"" number of useful votes. Add this condition to the `WHERE` clause: `AND review_votes_useful LIKE 'Medium'`.  6. **Count the Filtered Reviews**:    - After applying all the filters, we need to count the number of reviews that meet all the criteria. Use the `COUNT()` function to achieve this: `SELECT COUNT(review_length)`.  7. **Formulate the Final SQL Query**:    - Combine all the above steps into a single SQL query:            SELECT COUNT(review_length)       FROM Reviews       WHERE user_id = 3         AND review_length LIKE 'Long'         AND review_votes_useful LIKE 'Medium';        8. **Validate the Solution**:    - Ensure that the query correctly counts the number of long reviews by user ID 3 that have received a medium number of useful votes.    - Check the logic and syntax to ensure the query will execute without errors.  By following these steps, we can systematically approach and solve the SQL problem.",,

Here’s how we can approach the problem:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - The task is to identify users with a high number of followers. This implies we need to focus on the column that represents the number of followers for each user.  2. **Review the Schema**:    - We have multiple tables in the schema, but the relevant table for this problem is the `Users` table, as it contains user-related information.    - Specifically, we need to identify which column in the `Users` table represents the number of followers. The column `user_fans` seems to be the one that indicates the number of followers.  3. **Identify the Criteria for ""High"" Followers**:    - The problem statement specifies users with a ""high"" number of followers. We need to determine how ""high"" is represented in the data. In this case, it appears that the `user_fans` column uses qualitative descriptors like 'Low', 'Medium', and 'High'.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - We need to select the `user_id` from the `Users` table where the `user_fans` value is 'High'.    - Since we are only interested in unique user IDs, we can use `GROUP BY` to ensure that each user ID appears only once in the result set.  5. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Based on the above understanding, the SQL query would be:            SELECT user_id FROM Users WHERE user_fans LIKE 'High' GROUP BY user_id;          - This query selects user IDs from the `Users` table where the `user_fans` column has the value 'High', and groups the results by `user_id` to ensure uniqueness.  6. **Verify the Query**:    - Ensure that the query correctly captures all users with 'High' followers and that there are no syntax errors.    - Consider edge cases, such as users with no followers or missing data, to ensure the query handles them appropriately.  By following these steps, we logically arrive at the solution to the problem, ensuring that we have considered all relevant aspects of the schema and the problem statement.",,

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement:**    - We need to determine the number of businesses that do not provide alcohol.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns:**    - From the schema, we identify that the `Attributes` table contains information about different attributes businesses might have, such as providing alcohol.    - The `Business_Attributes` table links businesses to their specific attributes and their values (e.g., whether they provide alcohol or not).  3. **Determine the Attribute of Interest:**    - We need to focus on the attribute related to alcohol. In the `Attributes` table, the column `attribute_name` contains the attribute names, and we are interested in the row where `attribute_name` is ""Alcohol"".  4. **Link Businesses to Their Attributes:**    - The `Business_Attributes` table links each business to its attributes using `attribute_id`. We need to join this table with the `Attributes` table to filter out the businesses based on the alcohol attribute.  5. **Filter Businesses That Do Not Provide Alcohol:**    - In the `Business_Attributes` table, the `attribute_value` column indicates whether a business provides alcohol. We are interested in businesses where `attribute_value` is ""none"", indicating that they do not provide alcohol.  6. **Construct the SQL Query:**    - Perform an INNER JOIN between the `Attributes` table and the `Business_Attributes` table on `attribute_id` to filter businesses based on the alcohol attribute.    - Use a WHERE clause to filter rows where `attribute_name` is ""Alcohol"" and `attribute_value` is ""none"".    - Use COUNT to determine the number of businesses that meet these criteria.  7. **Write the SQL Query:**    - The final SQL query is:            SELECT COUNT(T1.attribute_id)      FROM Attributes AS T1      INNER JOIN Business_Attributes AS T2 ON T1.attribute_id = T2.attribute_id      WHERE T1.attribute_name LIKE 'Alcohol' AND T2.attribute_value LIKE 'none'        By following these logical steps, we can systematically approach the problem and construct a query that accurately counts the number of businesses that do not provide alcohol.",,

This involves finding businesses that have a specific attribute set to true.  2. **Examine the Schema**:    - Identify the relevant tables and columns. We have two tables of interest:      - `Attributes`: Contains `attribute_id` and `attribute_name`.      - `Business_Attributes`: Contains `attribute_id`, `business_id`, and `attribute_value`.  3. **Identify the Attribute**:    - From the `Attributes` table, locate the attribute named ""Good for Kids"". This will help us find the corresponding `attribute_id`.  4. **Link Attributes to Businesses**:    - Use the `Business_Attributes` table to link the `attribute_id` from the `Attributes` table to the `business_id`. This table also contains `attribute_value`, which indicates whether the attribute is set to true or false for a business.  5. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Perform an INNER JOIN between the `Attributes` and `Business_Attributes` tables using the `attribute_id` to connect them.    - Filter the results to include only those rows where `attribute_name` is ""Good for Kids"" and `attribute_value` is ""TRUE"".  6. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Based on the above logic, the SQL query would be:            SELECT T2.business_id       FROM Attributes AS T1       INNER JOIN Business_Attributes AS T2       ON T1.attribute_id = T2.attribute_id       WHERE T1.attribute_name LIKE 'Good for Kids'       AND T2.attribute_value LIKE 'TRUE';        7. **Verify the Solution**:    - Ensure that the query correctly identifies all businesses with the ""Good for Kids"" attribute set to true by checking against sample data or test cases.

We need to find a connection between businesses and their categories.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**:     - The `Categories` table contains information about different categories, including a `category_id` and `category_name`.    - The `Business_Categories` table links businesses to categories through `business_id` and `category_id`.  3. **Determine the Relationship**:     - The `Categories` table provides the category names, and the `Business_Categories` table associates these categories with specific businesses using `category_id`.  4. **Formulate the Query**:    - We need to count the number of businesses that fall under the ""Shopping"" category. This requires filtering the `Categories` table for the category name ""Shopping"" and counting the corresponding entries in the `Business_Categories` table.  5. **Join the Tables**:    - Use an `INNER JOIN` to connect the `Categories` table with the `Business_Categories` table on the `category_id` column. This will allow us to filter businesses by category name.  6. **Apply the Filter**:    - Add a `WHERE` clause to filter the results for the category name ""Shopping"". Use the `LIKE` operator to ensure the query is flexible and can handle variations in case or additional text.  7. **Count the Results**:    - Use the `COUNT` function to count the number of entries in the `Business_Categories` table that match the ""Shopping"" category.  8. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Combine the above steps into a coherent SQL query:            SELECT COUNT(T1.category_id)      FROM Categories AS T1      INNER JOIN Business_Categories AS T2 ON T1.category_id = T2.category_id      WHERE T1.category_name LIKE 'Shopping'        9. **Review and Test**:    - Review the query to ensure it accurately reflects the problem requirements.    - Test the query against the database to verify it returns the correct count of businesses in the ""Shopping"" category.

Here's how one might approach this problem:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: We need to identify the categories associated with a specific business, specifically Yelp_Business no. 1. This requires us to look into the relationships between businesses and categories.  2. **Examine the Schema**: Review the schema provided to identify which tables and columns are relevant to the problem. In this case, the tables `Business`, `Categories`, and `Business_Categories` are of interest.  3. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - **Categories Table**: Contains `category_id` and `category_name`, which will help us map category IDs to their names.    - **Business_Categories Table**: Contains `business_id` and `category_id`, which links businesses to their categories.  4. **Determine the Relationship**: Understand that the `Business_Categories` table acts as a bridge between the `Business` and `Categories` tables, linking businesses to their respective categories through `category_id`.  5. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - We need to select the `category_name` from the `Categories` table.    - Use an INNER JOIN to connect the `Categories` table with the `Business_Categories` table on `category_id`.    - Filter the results to only include entries where `business_id` is 1, as we are interested in Yelp_Business no. 1.  6. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Use the SELECT statement to choose `category_name` from the `Categories` table.    - Use INNER JOIN to combine `Categories` and `Business_Categories` on `category_id`.    - Apply a WHERE clause to filter for `business_id = 1`.  7. **Verify the Query**: Ensure that the query correctly retrieves the category names associated with Yelp_Business no. 1 by checking the logical flow and the relationships used.

Here are the logical steps that could have been taken to reach the solution:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to find the count of businesses that are still running (active) and belong to the ""Food"" category.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - **Categories**: Contains `category_id` and `category_name`, which will help us identify the ""Food"" category.    - **Business_Categories**: Links businesses to their categories using `business_id` and `category_id`.    - **Business**: Contains `business_id` and `active` status, which will help us filter for active businesses.  3. **Determine the Relationships**:    - **Categories** and **Business_Categories** can be joined on `category_id`.    - **Business_Categories** and **Business** can be joined on `business_id`.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Start by selecting the necessary columns. We need to count the number of businesses, so we will use `COUNT(T3.business_id)`.    - Use `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables:      - Join **Categories** (`T1`) with **Business_Categories** (`T2`) on `category_id` to filter businesses by category.      - Join the result with **Business** (`T3`) on `business_id` to filter for active businesses.    - Apply the necessary conditions in the `WHERE` clause:      - Filter for the ""Food"" category using `T1.category_name LIKE 'Food'`.      - Ensure the business is active using `T3.active LIKE 'TRUE'`.  5. **Write the SQL Query**:    - The final query is:            SELECT COUNT(T3.business_id)       FROM Categories AS T1       INNER JOIN Business_Categories AS T2 ON T1.category_id = T2.category_id       INNER JOIN Business AS T3 ON T2.business_id = T3.business_id       WHERE T1.category_name LIKE 'Food' AND T3.active LIKE 'TRUE'        6. **Verify the Solution**:    - Ensure that the query logic aligns with the problem requirements.    - Check that all necessary joins and conditions are correctly implemented.

The relevant tables here are `Categories`, `Business_Categories`, and `Business`.    - `Categories` contains category information with `category_id` and `category_name`.    - `Business_Categories` links businesses to categories using `business_id` and `category_id`.    - `Business` contains business details such as `business_id`, `city`, and other attributes.  2. **Identify the Relevant Tables**:    - We need to find businesses in the ""Food"" category, so we need to use the `Categories` table to identify the category.    - We need to find businesses located in Anthem, so we need to use the `Business` table to filter by city.    - The `Business_Categories` table will help us link businesses to their categories.  3. **Formulate the Query**:    - Start by selecting the necessary data from the `Categories` table where the `category_name` is ""Food"".    - Use an INNER JOIN to link the `Categories` table to the `Business_Categories` table on the `category_id` to get all businesses that fall under the ""Food"" category.    - Use another INNER JOIN to link the `Business_Categories` table to the `Business` table on the `business_id` to get business details, specifically filtering businesses located in Anthem.  4. **Filter and Count**:    - Apply a WHERE clause to filter the results to only include businesses where the `city` is ""Anthem"".    - Use the COUNT function to count the number of businesses that meet these criteria.  5. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Combine all the steps into a single SQL query:            SELECT COUNT(T3.business_id)      FROM Categories AS T1      INNER JOIN Business_Categories AS T2 ON T1.category_id = T2.category_id      INNER JOIN Business AS T3 ON T2.business_id = T3.business_id      WHERE T1.category_name LIKE 'Food' AND T3.city LIKE 'Anthem'        By following these logical steps, we ensure that we accurately count the number of businesses in Anthem that are categorized under ""Food"".",,

Here’s how you might approach the problem:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: We need to count the number of businesses that fall under the ""Food"" category and have the attribute ""Good for Kids"" set to true.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - **Categories**: To find businesses under the ""Food"" category, we need to use the `category_name` column.    - **Business_Categories**: This table links businesses to their categories using `business_id` and `category_id`.    - **Business**: This table contains the businesses and their details. We need the `business_id` to link with other tables.    - **Attributes**: To find the ""Good for Kids"" attribute, we need to use the `attribute_name` column.    - **Business_Attributes**: This table links businesses to their attributes using `business_id` and `attribute_id`.  3. **Plan the Joins**:    - Start by joining the `Categories` table with the `Business_Categories` table to filter businesses that belong to the ""Food"" category.    - Next, join the resulting set with the `Business` table to get business details.    - Then, join with the `Business_Attributes` table to access the attributes of each business.    - Finally, join with the `Attributes` table to filter for the ""Good for Kids"" attribute.  4. **Apply Filters**:    - In the `Categories` table, filter for `category_name` = 'Food'.    - In the `Attributes` table, filter for `attribute_name` = 'Good for Kids'.    - In the `Business_Attributes` table, filter for `attribute_value` = 'TRUE' to ensure the business is good for kids.  5. **Count the Results**:    - Use the `COUNT` function to count the number of businesses that meet all the criteria.  6. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Combine all the steps into a single SQL query using INNER JOINs and WHERE clauses to apply the necessary filters.  Here's the SQL query that implements these steps:   SELECT COUNT(T3.stars) FROM Categories AS T1 INNER JOIN Business_Categories AS T2 ON T1.category_id = T2.category_id INNER JOIN Business AS T3 ON T2.business_id = T3.business_id INNER JOIN Business_Attributes AS T4 ON T3.business_id = T4.business_id INNER JOIN Attributes AS T5 ON T4.attribute_id = T5.attribute_id WHERE T1.category_name LIKE 'Food' AND T5.attribute_name LIKE 'Good for Kids' AND T4.attribute_value LIKE 'TRUE';   By following these logical steps, you can systematically approach the problem and construct a query that provides the desired solution.",,

Here are the steps:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to list all unique categories associated with businesses located in the state of Arizona (AZ).  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**:    - From the schema, identify the tables that contain information about businesses and categories.    - The `Business` table contains information about each business, including its location (state).    - The `Categories` table contains the names of categories.    - The `Business_Categories` table links businesses to their respective categories.  3. **Determine Necessary Columns**:    - From the `Business` table, we need the `state` column to filter businesses located in Arizona.    - From the `Categories` table, we need the `category_name` to list the category names.    - From the `Business_Categories` table, we need the `business_id` and `category_id` to join with the `Business` and `Categories` tables.  4. **Plan the Joins**:    - We need to join the `Categories` table with the `Business_Categories` table on `category_id` to associate category names with business IDs.    - Then, join the result with the `Business` table on `business_id` to filter businesses located in Arizona.  5. **Apply the Filter**:    - Use a `WHERE` clause to filter businesses where `state` is 'AZ'.  6. **Ensure Uniqueness**:    - Since we want a list of unique categories, use `GROUP BY` on `category_name` to ensure each category is listed only once.  7. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Combine the above steps into a SQL query:            SELECT T1.category_name       FROM Categories AS T1       INNER JOIN Business_Categories AS T2 ON T1.category_id = T2.category_id       INNER JOIN Business AS T3 ON T2.business_id = T3.business_id       WHERE T3.state LIKE 'AZ'       GROUP BY T1.category_name        8. **Review and Validate**:    - Ensure the query logic aligns with the problem requirements.    - Validate the query against the schema to ensure all joins and conditions are correctly applied.  By following these steps, we systematically break down the problem, identify the necessary data and relationships, and construct a query that provides the desired result.",,

Here's a breakdown of the thought process:  1. **Understand the Problem**:     - We need to find out the duration for which a specific business (Yelp_Business no.1) is open on Tuesdays.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**:    - From the schema provided, the `Business_Hours` table contains information about the opening and closing times of businesses.    - The `Days` table contains information about the days of the week.  3. **Determine Necessary Columns**:    - From the `Business_Hours` table, we need the `business_id`, `day_id`, `opening_time`, and `closing_time` columns.    - From the `Days` table, we need the `day_id` and `day_of_week` columns to identify Tuesday.  4. **Filter for Specific Business and Day**:    - We need to filter the `Business_Hours` table for `business_id = 1` to focus on Yelp_Business no.1.    - We need to filter for the day of the week being Tuesday. This requires joining the `Business_Hours` table with the `Days` table on `day_id` and filtering for `day_of_week = 'Tuesday'`.  5. **Calculate Opening Duration**:    - Once we have the opening and closing times for the business on Tuesday, we need to calculate the duration it is open. This can be done by subtracting `opening_time` from `closing_time`.  6. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Use an `INNER JOIN` to combine `Business_Hours` and `Days` tables based on `day_id`.    - Use a `WHERE` clause to filter for `business_id = 1` and `day_of_week = 'Tuesday'`.    - Calculate the difference between `closing_time` and `opening_time` to get the opening duration.  7. **Write the Solution**:    - The SQL query is constructed as follows:            SELECT T1.closing_time - T1.opening_time AS ""opening hours""      FROM Business_Hours AS T1      INNER JOIN Days AS T2 ON T1.day_id = T2.day_id      WHERE T2.day_of_week LIKE 'Tuesday' AND T1.business_id = 1        By following these steps, we ensure that we correctly identify the business hours for Yelp_Business no.1 on Tuesdays and calculate the duration it is open.",,

Here is a breakdown of the reasoning process:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: We need to find out the opening time for a specific business (Yelp_Business no.1) on a specific day (Tuesday).  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**:    - **Business_Hours**: This table contains information about the opening and closing times of businesses. It is crucial because it directly relates to the business hours we are interested in.    - **Days**: This table maps day IDs to the actual days of the week. It is necessary to translate the day_id in the Business_Hours table to the day name (Tuesday).  3. **Determine Necessary Columns**:    - From the **Business_Hours** table, we need:      - `business_id`: To filter for Yelp_Business no.1.      - `day_id`: To match with the day of the week.      - `opening_time`: To retrieve the opening time.    - From the **Days** table, we need:      - `day_id`: To join with the Business_Hours table.      - `day_of_week`: To filter for Tuesday.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - **Join Tables**: Use an INNER JOIN to combine the Business_Hours and Days tables based on the `day_id`. This allows us to access the day of the week corresponding to each day_id.    - **Apply Filters**:      - Filter the results to only include records where `business_id` is 1, ensuring we only get information for Yelp_Business no.1.      - Filter for `day_of_week` being 'Tuesday' to get the opening time for the correct day.    - **Select the Desired Output**: Retrieve the `opening_time` from the filtered results.  5. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Combine the above steps into a coherent SQL query:            SELECT T1.opening_time      FROM Business_Hours AS T1      INNER JOIN Days AS T2 ON T1.day_id = T2.day_id      WHERE T2.day_of_week LIKE 'Tuesday' AND T1.business_id = 1        6. **Verify the Solution**: Ensure that the query logically retrieves the correct information by checking the schema and ensuring all joins and filters are correctly applied.  By following these steps, we can confidently determine the opening time for Yelp_Business no.1 on Tuesdays using the provided database schema.",,

This involves working with business hours and filtering based on the day of the week.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - The `Business_Hours` table is relevant because it contains information about the opening and closing times of businesses.    - The `Days` table is relevant because it provides the mapping of day IDs to the actual day names, which will help us filter for Mondays.  3. **Determine Necessary Joins**:    - We need to join the `Business_Hours` table with the `Days` table to associate each entry in `Business_Hours` with the corresponding day of the week. This is done using the `day_id` column present in both tables.  4. **Filter for Specific Conditions**:    - We need to filter the results to only include entries where the day of the week is Monday. This can be achieved by checking if `day_of_week` is 'Monday'.    - Additionally, we need to filter for businesses that close after 8 PM. This is done by checking if the `closing_time` is greater than '8PM'.  5. **Count the Results**:    - Once the filtering is done, we need to count the number of unique `business_id` entries that meet the criteria. This will give us the total number of businesses that close after 8 PM on Mondays.  6. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Using the above logic, we can construct the SQL query:            SELECT COUNT(T1.business_id)      FROM Business_Hours AS T1      INNER JOIN Days AS T2 ON T1.day_id = T2.day_id      WHERE T2.day_of_week LIKE 'Monday'      AND T1.closing_time > '8PM';        7. **Verify and Test the Query**:    - Before finalizing, ensure that the query correctly captures all businesses that meet the criteria by testing it on sample data or a subset of the database.

This involves filtering businesses based on location, day of the week, and closing time.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - **Business**: To filter businesses located in Arizona.    - **Business_Hours**: To find businesses that close at 12 PM.    - **Days**: To identify the day of the week as Sunday.  3. **Determine the Necessary Joins**:    - We need to join the `Business_Hours` table with the `Days` table to match the day of the week with Sunday.    - We also need to join the `Business_Hours` table with the `Business` table to ensure the business is located in Arizona.  4. **Filter Conditions**:    - Use the `Days` table to filter for Sunday by checking where `day_of_week` is 'Sunday'.    - Use the `Business_Hours` table to filter for businesses that close at 12 PM by checking where `closing_time` is '12PM'.    - Use the `Business` table to filter for businesses located in Arizona by checking where `state` is 'AZ'.  5. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Start with the `SELECT` statement to count the number of businesses.    - Use `INNER JOIN` to combine `Business_Hours` with `Days` on `day_id` to filter for Sunday.    - Use another `INNER JOIN` to combine the result with `Business` on `business_id` to filter for businesses in Arizona.    - Apply the `WHERE` clause to enforce the conditions for Sunday, 12 PM closing time, and Arizona location.  6. **Execute and Verify**:    - Run the SQL query to get the count of businesses that meet all the specified criteria.  By following these steps, we arrive at the SQL query:   SELECT COUNT(T1.business_id) FROM Business_Hours AS T1 INNER JOIN Days AS T2 ON T1.day_id = T2.day_id INNER JOIN Business AS T3 ON T1.business_id = T3.business_id WHERE T2.day_of_week LIKE 'Sunday' AND T1.closing_time LIKE '12PM' AND T3.state LIKE 'AZ';   This query effectively counts the number of businesses in Arizona that close at 12 PM on Sundays.",,

Here's how you might approach the problem:  1. **Understand the Requirement**:     - We need to find the categories of businesses that close at 12 PM on Sundays. This involves identifying businesses with specific closing times on a specific day and then determining their associated categories.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**:    - From the schema, identify the tables that contain the necessary information:      - `Business_Hours`: Contains information about business hours, including closing times and the day of the week.      - `Days`: Provides the mapping of day IDs to the actual day names (e.g., Sunday).      - `Business_Categories`: Links businesses to their categories.      - `Categories`: Contains the category names.  3. **Determine Necessary Joins**:    - To get the required information, we need to join several tables:      - Join `Business_Hours` with `Days` to filter businesses that close at 12 PM on Sundays.      - Join the result with `Business_Categories` to get the category IDs for these businesses.      - Finally, join with `Categories` to get the category names.  4. **Filter for Specific Conditions**:    - In the `Business_Hours` table, filter for `closing_time = '12PM'`.    - In the `Days` table, filter for `day_of_week = 'Sunday'`.  5. **Select and Group the Results**:    - After joining the tables and applying the filters, select the category names.    - Use `GROUP BY` to ensure each category name is listed only once, as a business might belong to multiple categories.  6. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Based on the above logic, construct the SQL query:            SELECT T4.category_name       FROM Business_Hours AS T1       INNER JOIN Days AS T2 ON T1.day_id = T2.day_id       INNER JOIN Business_Categories AS T3 ON T1.business_id = T3.business_id       INNER JOIN Categories AS T4 ON T3.category_id = T4.category_id       WHERE T1.closing_time = '12PM'       AND T2.day_of_week = 'Sunday'       GROUP BY T4.category_name;        7. **Verify the Query**:    - Ensure the query logic aligns with the problem requirements and that all necessary tables and conditions are included.    - Check the query for syntax errors and logical correctness.  By following these steps, you can systematically approach the problem and derive the solution.",,

This involves comparing the year a user joined Yelp with the year they became an elite user.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**: Based on the problem, the relevant tables are `Users` and `Elite`. The `Users` table contains information about when a user started using Yelp (`user_yelping_since_year`), and the `Elite` table contains information about the years users achieved elite status (`year_id`).  3. **Determine the Relationship Between Tables**: Both tables have a common column, `user_id`, which can be used to join the tables. This allows us to match each user with their corresponding elite status records.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - **Join the Tables**: Use an INNER JOIN to combine the `Users` and `Elite` tables on the `user_id` column. This will give us access to both the year a user joined Yelp and the years they became elite.    - **Filter the Results**: Add a WHERE clause to filter the records where the year a user joined Yelp (`user_yelping_since_year`) is equal to the year they became elite (`year_id`).    - **Count the Matching Users**: Use the COUNT function to count the number of users who satisfy the condition.  5. **Write the SQL Query**:        SELECT COUNT(T1.user_id)    FROM Users AS T1    INNER JOIN Elite AS T2 ON T1.user_id = T2.user_id    WHERE T1.user_yelping_since_year = T2.year_id;      6. **Verify the Solution**: Ensure that the query correctly counts the users who became elite in the same year they joined Yelp by checking the logic and running the query against the database.  By following these steps, we can systematically arrive at the solution to the problem, ensuring that we consider all necessary components and relationships within the database schema.",,

Adjust for any time format issues (e.g., AM/PM) if necessary. In this case, the solution uses `closing_time + 12 - opening_time` to handle the time format.  6. **Order and Limit Results**:    - Order the results by the calculated business hours in descending order to find the longest duration.    - Use `LIMIT 1` to select only the top result, which represents the longest business time.  7. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Combine all the above steps into a single SQL query that performs the necessary joins, filters, calculations, and ordering to achieve the desired result.

The final SQL query is:  SELECT T1.business_id  FROM Business_Hours AS T1  INNER JOIN Days AS T2 ON T1.day_id = T2.day_id  INNER JOIN Business AS T3 ON T1.business_id = T3.business_id  WHERE T1.closing_time + 12 - T1.opening_time > 12  AND T2.day_of_week LIKE 'Sunday'  GROUP BY T1.business_id;   This query joins the necessary tables, filters for Sundays, calculates the business hours, and selects business IDs that meet the criteria.",,

We need to use this table to filter out elite users.    - **Reviews Table**: This table contains reviews made by users for various businesses. We need to use this table to find reviews for business no.1.    - **Users Table**: This table contains user information, which can be used to join with the Elite table to ensure we are counting elite users.  3. **Determine the Necessary Joins**:    - We need to join the **Users** table with the **Elite** table to identify users who are elite.    - We also need to join the **Reviews** table with the result of the previous join to filter reviews made by elite users.  4. **Filter for Specific Business**:    - After joining the necessary tables, we need to filter the results to only include reviews for business no.1. This can be done using a `WHERE` clause on the `business_id` column in the Reviews table.  5. **Count the Unique Elite Users**:    - Once we have filtered the reviews to only include those made by elite users for business no.1, we need to count the number of unique users. This can be achieved using the `COUNT` function on the `user_id` column.  6. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Using the above steps, we can construct the SQL query as follows:            SELECT COUNT(T1.user_id)      FROM Users AS T1      INNER JOIN Elite AS T2 ON T1.user_id = T2.user_id      INNER JOIN Reviews AS T3 ON T1.user_id = T3.user_id      WHERE T3.business_id = 1        7. **Verify the Solution**:    - Ensure that the query correctly counts the number of unique elite users who have reviewed business no.1 by checking the logic and the relationships between the tables.

Here's how we can approach this:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: We need to find the business located in Arizona that has received the highest number of reviews. This requires us to focus on the `Business` and `Reviews` tables.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - The `Business` table contains information about businesses, including their location (`state` column) and a unique identifier (`business_id`).    - The `Reviews` table contains reviews associated with businesses, identified by `business_id`.  3. **Filter Businesses by Location**:    - Since the problem is specific to Arizona, we need to filter businesses where the `state` column in the `Business` table is 'AZ'.  4. **Join Tables**:    - To associate reviews with their respective businesses, we need to perform an inner join between the `Reviews` table and the `Business` table on the `business_id` column.  5. **Count Reviews per Business**:    - After joining the tables, we need to count the number of reviews for each business. This can be done using the `COUNT` function on the `business_id` from the `Reviews` table.  6. **Group and Order Results**:    - Group the results by `business_id` to aggregate the review counts for each business.    - Order the results in descending order based on the review count to identify the business with the most reviews.  7. **Select the Top Result**:    - Use the `LIMIT` clause to select the top result, which will be the business with the highest number of reviews.  8. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - The SQL query should reflect the above steps, ensuring that the join, filtering, counting, grouping, and ordering are correctly implemented.  Here's how the SQL query would look based on these logical steps:   SELECT T2.business_id FROM Reviews AS T1 INNER JOIN Business AS T2 ON T1.business_id = T2.business_id WHERE T2.state = 'AZ' GROUP BY T2.business_id ORDER BY COUNT(T1.business_id) DESC LIMIT 1;   This query will return the `business_id` of the business in Arizona with the most reviews. Note that the provided solution in the prompt seems to have an error, as it selects `user_id` instead of `business_id`. The correct solution should focus on `business_id` to answer the problem statement.",,

Here is a breakdown of the reasoning process:  1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to calculate the average number of stars given to businesses located in Anthem based on user reviews. This requires identifying the relevant tables and columns that contain information about businesses, their locations, and the reviews they receive.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**:     - The `Business` table contains information about businesses, including their `business_id`, `city`, and other attributes.    - The `Reviews` table contains user reviews, including `business_id` and `review_stars`.  3. **Determine the Relationship Between Tables**:     - The `Business` table and the `Reviews` table are related through the `business_id` column. This relationship allows us to join these tables to associate businesses with their reviews.  4. **Filter Businesses by Location**:     - We need to focus only on businesses located in Anthem. This can be done by filtering the `Business` table where the `city` column is 'Anthem'.  5. **Join Tables**:     - Perform an INNER JOIN between the `Business` table and the `Reviews` table on the `business_id` column. This will allow us to link each business in Anthem to its corresponding reviews.  6. **Calculate the Average Stars**:     - Once we have the relevant reviews for businesses in Anthem, we need to calculate the average of the `review_stars` from the `Reviews` table.  7. **Formulate the SQL Query**:     - Using the insights from the above steps, we construct the SQL query:            SELECT AVG(T2.review_stars)       FROM Business AS T1       INNER JOIN Reviews AS T2       ON T1.business_id = T2.business_id       WHERE T1.city LIKE 'Anthem'          - This query selects the average of `review_stars` from the `Reviews` table for businesses in Anthem by joining the `Business` and `Reviews` tables on `business_id` and filtering for the city 'Anthem'.  8. **Verify the Solution**:     - Ensure the query logic aligns with the problem requirements and that it correctly calculates the desired average.  By following these steps, we can logically arrive at the solution to find the average star rating for Yelp businesses in Anthem based on user reviews.",,

Therefore, filter the `Business` table to include only those records where the `state` column is 'AZ'.  5. **Filter Reviews by User**:     - We are interested in reviews made by user no. 3. Therefore, filter the `Reviews` table to include only those records where `user_id` is 3.  6. **Join the Tables**:     - Perform an INNER JOIN between the `Business` and `Reviews` tables using the `business_id` column to combine the relevant data. This will allow us to associate each review made by user no. 3 with the corresponding business in Arizona.  7. **Calculate the Average Stars**:     - After filtering and joining the tables, calculate the average of the `review_stars` for the resulting dataset. This will give us the average number of stars user no. 3 gives to businesses in Arizona.  8. **Formulate the SQL Query**:     - Based on the above steps, the SQL query is constructed as follows:            SELECT AVG(T2.review_stars)      FROM Business AS T1      INNER JOIN Reviews AS T2 ON T1.business_id = T2.business_id      WHERE T1.state LIKE 'AZ' AND T2.user_id = 3;        By following these logical steps, we ensure that we correctly filter, join, and aggregate the data to answer the problem statement.",,

However, the solution seems to only consider Sunday, which might be an oversight or specific to the dataset. Ensure to include both Saturday and Sunday if required.  4. **Join Tables to Get Complete Information**:    - Join the `Business_Hours` table with the `Days` table to get the day of the week for each entry in `Business_Hours`.  5. **Filter Data for the Specific Business and Weekend Days**:    - Filter the results to include only records where `business_id` is 1.    - Further filter the results to include only the days that are considered weekends (in this case, Sunday).  6. **Calculate Business Hours**:    - For each relevant record, calculate the business hours by subtracting the `opening_time` from the `closing_time`.    - Note: The solution provided uses a simple arithmetic operation `closing_time + 12 - opening_time`, which assumes a 12-hour format and might need adjustment based on the actual time format.  7. **Compute the Average**:    - Once the business hours for each weekend day are calculated, compute the average of these hours.  8. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Use SQL to implement the above logic. The provided solution is:            SELECT T1.closing_time + 12 - T1.opening_time AS ""avg opening hours""      FROM Business_Hours AS T1      INNER JOIN Days AS T2 ON T1.day_id = T2.day_id      WHERE T1.business_id = 1 AND (T2.day_of_week = 'Sunday' OR T2.day_of_week = 'Sunday')          - Ensure that the logic for calculating hours and filtering for weekends is correctly implemented.  9. **Verify and Adjust if Necessary**:    - Verify the results to ensure they make sense (e.g., check if both Saturday and Sunday should be included).    - Adjust the query if necessary to correct any logical errors or assumptions.

Here's how we can break down the process:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to list business IDs that have a star rating between 2 and 3 and are located in Mesa.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - From the schema, the `Business` table is relevant because it contains information about businesses, including their IDs, locations (city), and star ratings.  3. **Determine the Necessary Conditions**:    - We need to filter businesses based on two conditions:      - The business must be located in Mesa (`city` column).      - The business must have a star rating between 2 and 3 (`stars` column).  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - We will use the `SELECT` statement to retrieve the `business_id` from the `Business` table.    - Use the `WHERE` clause to apply the conditions:      - Use `city LIKE 'Mesa'` to filter businesses located in Mesa.      - Use `stars BETWEEN 2 AND 3` to filter businesses with star ratings between 2 and 3.  5. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Combine the above steps into a complete SQL query:            SELECT business_id       FROM Business       WHERE city LIKE 'Mesa'       AND stars BETWEEN 2 AND 3;        6. **Verify the Solution**:    - Ensure that the query correctly reflects the problem statement and uses the correct table and column names from the schema.    - Check that the logical operators (`LIKE` and `BETWEEN`) are used appropriately to filter the data as required.  By following these steps, we logically arrive at the solution to the SQL problem.",,

Here are the logical steps to arrive at the solution:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement:**    - We need to find users who started yelping between the years 2011 and 2013.    - Among these users, we are interested in those who have a high count of fans.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns:**    - The `Users` table is relevant because it contains information about users, including when they started yelping and their fan count.    - The columns of interest in the `Users` table are `user_yelping_since_year` and `user_fans`.  3. **Filter Users by Yelping Start Year:**    - We need to filter the users whose `user_yelping_since_year` is between 2011 and 2013. This can be done using a `WHERE` clause with a `BETWEEN` condition.  4. **Filter Users by Fan Count:**    - We are interested in users with a high count of fans. The `user_fans` column should be checked for the value 'High'.    - This can be done by adding another condition to the `WHERE` clause to filter `user_fans` for 'High'.  5. **Count the Number of Users:**    - Once we have filtered the users based on the above criteria, we need to count how many such users exist.    - This can be achieved using the `COUNT()` function in SQL.  6. **Formulate the SQL Query:**    - Combine the above steps into a single SQL query:            SELECT COUNT(user_id)      FROM Users      WHERE user_yelping_since_year BETWEEN 2011 AND 2013      AND user_fans LIKE 'High'        7. **Verify the Solution:**    - Ensure that the query correctly captures the requirements by checking the logic and syntax.    - Consider edge cases, such as users with no fan count or those who started yelping exactly in 2011 or 2013, to ensure they are included or excluded as appropriate.  By following these steps, we can systematically approach and solve the SQL problem, ensuring that all conditions are met and the correct data is retrieved.",,

The `Reviews` table is the most relevant as it contains columns related to reviews, including `user_id`, `business_id`, and `review_length`.  3. **Determine Necessary Columns**: From the `Reviews` table, we need to focus on the columns `user_id`, `business_id`, and `review_length`. These columns will allow us to filter the data by user and business and retrieve the review length.  4. **Formulate the Query**:    - **Select Clause**: We want to retrieve the `review_length`, so the query should start with `SELECT review_length`.    - **From Clause**: Since the data is located in the `Reviews` table, include `FROM Reviews`.    - **Where Clause**: To filter the results to only include the review by user 35026 for business 2, add `WHERE user_id = 35026 AND business_id = 2`.  5. **Write the SQL Query**: Combine the above components to form the complete SQL query:        SELECT review_length FROM Reviews WHERE user_id = 35026 AND business_id = 2;      6. **Review and Validate**: Double-check the query to ensure it correctly targets the desired data.

Here are the logical steps to arrive at the solution:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to find businesses categorized as ""Mexican"" with a star rating below 4. This requires us to filter businesses based on their category and star rating.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**:    - From the schema, the relevant tables are:      - `Business`: Contains information about businesses, including their star ratings.      - `Business_Categories`: Links businesses to their categories.      - `Categories`: Contains the names of categories.  3. **Determine Necessary Joins**:    - We need to join the `Business` table with the `Business_Categories` table to associate each business with its categories.    - We then join the `Business_Categories` table with the `Categories` table to get the category names.  4. **Filter by Category Name**:    - Use the `Categories` table to filter for businesses that have the category name ""Mexican"". This requires a condition on the `category_name` column.  5. **Filter by Star Rating**:    - Use the `Business` table to filter businesses with a star rating below 4.

Here are the logical steps that could have been taken to reach the solution:  1. **Understand the Schema and Problem Requirements:**    - Review the schema to understand the relationships between tables and the columns available.    - Identify the key tables involved: `Business`, `Business_Categories`, and `Categories`.    - Recognize that we need to filter businesses based on their activity status and category.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns:**    - The `Business` table contains `business_id`, `active` status, and `stars`.    - The `Business_Categories` table links `business_id` to `category_id`.    - The `Categories` table contains `category_id` and `category_name`.  3. **Determine the Necessary Joins:**    - To associate businesses with their categories, join `Business` with `Business_Categories` using `business_id`.    - To identify the category name, join `Business_Categories` with `Categories` using `category_id`.  4. **Filter for Active Businesses:**    - Use a WHERE clause to filter businesses where `active` is true. This ensures we only consider active businesses.  5. **Filter for the Fashion Category:**    - Add a condition to filter the results to only include businesses where the `category_name` is ""Fashion"".  6. **Select Required Columns:**    - Select the `business_id` and `stars` from the `Business` table as these are the required outputs.  7. **Write the SQL Query:**    - Combine all the above steps into a coherent SQL query using INNER JOINs and WHERE clauses to apply the necessary filters.  8. **Verify the Solution:**    - Ensure the query logic aligns with the problem requirements and that it correctly retrieves the desired information.  The resulting SQL query is:   SELECT T1.business_id, T1.stars  FROM Business AS T1  INNER JOIN Business_Categories ON T1.business_id = Business_Categories.business_id  INNER JOIN Categories AS T3 ON Business_Categories.category_id = T3.category_id  WHERE T1.active LIKE 'TRUE'  AND T3.category_name LIKE 'Fashion'   This query effectively retrieves the active business IDs and their stars for businesses categorized under ""Fashion.""",,

This involves analyzing the star ratings of businesses and associating them with their respective categories.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**: From the given schema, identify the tables that are relevant to the problem:    - `Business`: Contains `business_id` and `stars`, which are crucial for finding the highest star rating.    - `Business_Categories`: Links `business_id` to `category_id`, allowing us to associate businesses with categories.    - `Categories`: Contains `category_id` and `category_name`, which are needed to get the name of the category.  3. **Determine the Relationships**: Understand how these tables are related:    - `Business` is linked to `Business_Categories` through `business_id`.    - `Business_Categories` is linked to `Categories` through `category_id`.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - **Join Tables**: Use SQL JOIN operations to combine the tables based on their relationships:      - Join `Business` with `Business_Categories` on `business_id` to get the categories associated with each business.      - Join the result with `Categories` on `category_id` to get the category names.    - **Order by Star Ratings**: Sort the results by the `stars` column in descending order to prioritize higher ratings.    - **Limit the Results**: Use `LIMIT 1` to get only the top result, which corresponds to the category with the highest star rating.  5. **Construct the SQL Query**:        SELECT T3.category_name    FROM Business AS T1    INNER JOIN Business_Categories AS T2 ON T1.business_id = T2.business_id    INNER JOIN Categories AS T3 ON T2.category_id = T3.category_id    ORDER BY T1.stars DESC    LIMIT 1;      6. **Verify the Solution**: Ensure that the query correctly identifies the category with the highest star rating by checking the logic and relationships used in the query.

This can be done by checking the `city` column in the `Business` table.  5. **Sort Businesses by Star Rating**:    - To find the business with the highest star rating, sort the results by the `stars` column in descending order.

The solution involves understanding the schema and how different tables relate to each other. Here are the logical steps to arrive at the solution:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement:**    - We need to list the category and attributes of businesses that are active, located in Chandler, AZ, and have a medium review count.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables:**    - From the schema, the relevant tables are:      - `Business`: Contains information about businesses, including their location, active status, and review count.      - `Business_Categories`: Links businesses to their categories.      - `Categories`: Contains category names.      - `Business_Attributes`: Links businesses to their attributes.      - `Attributes`: Contains attribute names.  3. **Determine Necessary Conditions:**    - The businesses must be active (`active = true`).    - The businesses must be located in Chandler, AZ (`city = 'Chandler'` and `state = 'AZ'`).    - The businesses must have a medium review count (`review_count = 'Medium'`).  4. **Plan the SQL Query:**    - We need to join the `Business` table with `Business_Categories` to get the category information.    - Then, join with the `Categories` table to get the category names.    - Similarly, join the `Business` table with `Business_Attributes` to get the attribute information.    - Finally, join with the `Attributes` table to get the attribute names.  5. **Construct the SQL Query:**    - Start with selecting the necessary columns: `category_name` from `Categories` and `attribute_name` from `Attributes`.    - Use `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on the business ID and category/attribute IDs.    - Apply the `WHERE` clause to filter businesses that are active, located in Chandler, AZ, and have a medium review count.  6. **Write the SQL Query:**        SELECT T3.category_name, T5.attribute_name    FROM Business AS T1    INNER JOIN Business_Categories ON T1.business_id = Business_Categories.business_id    INNER JOIN Categories AS T3 ON Business_Categories.category_id = T3.category_id    INNER JOIN Business_Attributes AS T4 ON T1.business_id = T4.business_id    INNER JOIN Attributes AS T5 ON T4.attribute_id = T5.attribute_id    WHERE T1.active LIKE 'TRUE'    AND T1.state LIKE 'AZ'    AND T1.city LIKE 'Chandler'    AND T1.review_count LIKE 'Medium';      7. **Verify the Solution:**    - Ensure that the query correctly joins the tables and applies the necessary filters.    - Check that the output meets the problem requirements, listing the category and attributes of the specified businesses.

Here's how we can approach the problem:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: We need to list the categories of businesses that are active and located in Surprise, AZ. This means we need to filter businesses based on their activity status and location, and then identify their categories.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**: From the schema provided, we identify that the relevant tables for this query are:    - `Business`: Contains information about each business, including whether it is active, its location (city and state), and its unique identifier (`business_id`).    - `Business_Categories`: Links businesses to their categories using `business_id` and `category_id`.    - `Categories`: Contains the names of categories, identified by `category_id`.  3. **Determine Necessary Joins**: To get the category names for businesses, we need to perform joins between these tables:    - Join `Business` with `Business_Categories` on `business_id` to associate each business with its categories.    - Join the result with `Categories` on `category_id` to get the category names.  4. **Apply Filters**: We need to filter businesses based on the following criteria:    - The business must be active (`active` column should be `TRUE`).    - The business must be located in Surprise, AZ (`city` column should be 'Surprise' and `state` column should be 'AZ').  5. **Select and Group Results**: After filtering, we select the category names. Since multiple businesses can belong to the same category, we use `GROUP BY` to ensure each category is listed only once.  6. **Write the SQL Query**: Combine all the above steps into a SQL query:        SELECT T3.category_name    FROM Business AS T1    INNER JOIN Business_Categories ON T1.business_id = Business_Categories.business_id    INNER JOIN Categories AS T3 ON Business_Categories.category_id = T3.category_id    WHERE T1.active LIKE 'TRUE'      AND T1.state LIKE 'AZ'      AND T1.city LIKE 'Surprise'    GROUP BY T3.category_name;      7. **Review and Validate**: Ensure the query logic aligns with the problem requirements and the schema structure. Validate the query against sample data to confirm it returns the expected results.  By following these logical steps, we systematically arrive at the solution to list the categories of active businesses in Surprise, AZ.",,

Here's how one might approach the problem:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to identify businesses that are open from 8 am to 9 pm on Fridays.    - The required output is the location (city) of these businesses.  2. **Review the Schema**:    - Identify relevant tables and columns:      - `Business`: Contains `business_id` and `city`.      - `Business_Hours`: Contains `business_id`, `day_id`, `opening_time`, and `closing_time`.      - `Days`: Contains `day_id` and `day_of_week`.  3. **Determine Necessary Joins**:    - To link business hours to specific days, join `Business_Hours` with `Days` using `day_id`.    - To associate business hours with business locations, join `Business_Hours` with `Business` using `business_id`.  4. **Filter for Specific Conditions**:    - Use the `Days` table to filter for records where `day_of_week` is 'Friday'.    - Use the `Business_Hours` table to filter for records where `opening_time` is '8AM' and `closing_time` is '9PM'.  5. **Select Required Output**:    - From the joined tables, select the `city` from the `Business` table.  6. **Group the Results**:    - Use `GROUP BY` to ensure each city appears only once in the results, even if multiple businesses in the same city meet the criteria.  7. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Combine the above steps into a single SQL query:            SELECT T1.city       FROM Business AS T1       INNER JOIN Business_Hours AS T2 ON T1.business_id = T2.business_id       INNER JOIN Days AS T3 ON T2.day_id = T3.day_id       WHERE T2.closing_time LIKE '9PM'       AND T2.opening_time LIKE '8AM'       AND T3.day_of_week LIKE 'Friday'       GROUP BY T1.city;        8. **Verify the Solution**:    - Ensure the query logic matches the problem requirements.    - Test the query on sample data to verify correctness.  By following these logical steps, we can systematically approach the problem and construct a solution that accurately retrieves the desired information from the database.",,

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logical reasoning process to arrive at the solution:  1. **Understand the Requirements:**    - We need to find opening times for businesses.    - The businesses must be located in Chandler.    - The businesses must be active.    - The businesses must have a medium review count.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables:**    - The `Business` table contains information about the business location, activity status, and review count.    - The `Business_Hours` table contains information about the opening times of businesses.    - The `Days` table can be used if we need to filter or display specific days, but it is not directly required for this query since the problem does not specify a particular day.  3. **Determine Necessary Joins:**    - We need to join the `Business` table with the `Business_Hours` table to link business information with their opening times.    - The join will be based on the `business_id`, which is common to both tables.  4. **Formulate the WHERE Clause:**    - We need to filter businesses that are located in Chandler. This can be done using `T1.city LIKE 'Chandler'`.    - We need to ensure the businesses are active. This can be done using `T1.active LIKE 'TRUE'`.    - We need to filter businesses with a medium review count. This can be done using `T1.review_count LIKE 'Medium'`.  5. **Select the Required Columns:**    - We are interested in the `opening_time` from the `Business_Hours` table.  6. **Ensure Uniqueness:**    - Since we are only interested in distinct opening times, we use `SELECT DISTINCT`.  7. **Construct the SQL Query:**    - Combine all the above steps to form the SQL query.  Here is the constructed SQL query based on the above reasoning:   SELECT DISTINCT T2.opening_time FROM Business AS T1 INNER JOIN Business_Hours AS T2 ON T1.business_id = T2.business_id WHERE T1.city LIKE 'Chandler'   AND T1.active LIKE 'TRUE'   AND T1.review_count LIKE 'Medium';   This query effectively retrieves the distinct opening times of businesses in Chandler that are active and have a medium review count.",,

By following these steps, we can construct a SQL query that accurately calculates the desired percentage. The final query is:   SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN T1.stars < 4 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(T1.stars) AS ""percentage"" FROM Business AS T1 INNER JOIN Business_Categories ON T1.business_id = Business_Categories.business_id INNER JOIN Categories AS T3 ON Business_Categories.category_id = T3.category_id WHERE T3.category_name LIKE 'Accessories'   This query effectively filters and calculates the percentage of businesses in the ""Accessories"" category with less than 4 stars.",,

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to list the closing time and day of the week for active businesses located in Tempe.    - These businesses must have a star rating greater than 70% of the average star rating of all active businesses in Tempe.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - The `Business` table contains information about businesses, including their location (`city`), status (`active`), and star ratings (`stars`).    - The `Business_Hours` table provides the closing times for businesses, which we need to extract.    - The `Days` table maps day IDs to the actual day of the week, which is necessary to translate day IDs from `Business_Hours` into meaningful day names.  3. **Determine the Necessary Joins**:    - We need to join the `Business` table with the `Business_Hours` table on `business_id` to access the closing times.    - We also need to join the `Business_Hours` table with the `Days` table on `day_id` to get the day of the week.  4. **Filter the Data**:    - Filter businesses to only include those located in Tempe (`city LIKE 'Tempe'`).    - Ensure businesses are active (`active LIKE 'TRUE'`).  5. **Calculate the Threshold for Star Ratings**:    - Calculate the average star rating of active businesses in Tempe.    - Multiply this average by 0.7 to get the threshold for filtering businesses.  6. **Apply the Star Rating Filter**:    - Only include businesses whose star rating is greater than the calculated threshold.  7. **Select the Required Columns**:    - From the filtered and joined data, select the `closing_time` from `Business_Hours` and `day_of_week` from `Days`.  8. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Use the `SELECT` statement to specify the columns to be retrieved.    - Use `INNER JOIN` to combine the necessary tables.    - Use `WHERE` clauses to apply the city, active status, and star rating filters.    - Use a subquery to calculate the average star rating and apply the 70% condition.  By following these steps, we ensure that the SQL query is logically structured to retrieve the desired information accurately. The final query is constructed as follows:   SELECT T2.closing_time, T3.day_of_week  FROM Business AS T1  INNER JOIN Business_Hours AS T2 ON T1.business_id = T2.business_id  INNER JOIN Days AS T3 ON T2.day_id = T3.day_id  WHERE T1.city LIKE 'Tempe'  AND T1.active LIKE 'TRUE'  AND T1.stars > 0.7 * (     SELECT AVG(T1.stars)      FROM Business AS T1      INNER JOIN Business_Hours AS T2 ON T1.business_id = T2.business_id      INNER JOIN Days AS T3 ON T2.day_id = T3.day_id      WHERE T1.city LIKE 'Tempe'      AND T1.active LIKE 'TRUE' );   This query effectively retrieves the closing times and corresponding days of the week for businesses in Tempe that meet the specified criteria.",,

The `Business` table is relevant because it includes columns such as `business_id`, `active`, `city`, and `state`.  3. **Determine Necessary Conditions**: We need to filter businesses based on two conditions:    - The business is active.    - The business is located in Phoenix, Arizona.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - **Select the Count**: Since we need the number of businesses, use the `COUNT` function on `business_id`.    - **Apply Filters**: Use the `WHERE` clause to filter businesses that are active and located in Phoenix, Arizona.    - **Check Active Status**: Ensure the `active` column is `true`.    - **Check Location**: Ensure the `city` column is `Phoenix` and the `state` column is `AZ`.  5. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Start with `SELECT COUNT(business_id)`.    - Use `FROM Business` to specify the table.    - Add `WHERE city LIKE 'Phoenix' AND active LIKE 'True'` to filter based on the city and active status.  6. **Review and Optimize**:    - Ensure the query correctly uses `LIKE` for string comparison, which is appropriate for SQL.    - Confirm that the conditions accurately reflect the problem requirements.  7. **Execute and Validate**: Run the query against the database to ensure it returns the correct count of active businesses in Phoenix, Arizona.  By following these steps, we arrive at the solution:    SELECT COUNT(business_id)  FROM Business  WHERE city LIKE 'Phoenix' AND active LIKE 'True';   This query effectively counts the number of businesses that meet the specified criteria.",,

The `Business` table is relevant here, specifically the `review_count` column.  3. **Analyze the Data Representation**: Review the sample data provided for the `review_count` column in the `Business` table. It uses qualitative descriptors like 'Low', 'Medium', and 'High' instead of numerical values.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - **Select the Data**: We need to count the number of businesses, so we will use the `COUNT` function.    - **Filter the Data**: We need to filter businesses where the `review_count` is 'High'.

This requires identifying businesses with specific attributes related to alcohol sales.  2. **Analyze the Schema**: Review the provided schema to identify relevant tables and columns. The `Business_Attributes` table seems pertinent as it contains `attribute_id`, `business_id`, and `attribute_value`, which likely describe business characteristics such as selling beer and wine.  3. **Identify Relevant Attributes**: Determine which attribute corresponds to selling beer and wine. The `Attributes` table contains an `attribute_name` column with values like ""Alcohol,"" which suggests it might be related to our query. However, since the solution directly uses `attribute_id = 1`, it implies that this ID corresponds to alcohol-related attributes.  4. **Determine the Attribute Value**: The solution specifies `attribute_value = 'beer_and_wine'`. This indicates that businesses with this attribute value under `attribute_id = 1` sell both beer and wine.  5. **Formulate the Query**: Construct an SQL query to count the number of distinct `business_id` entries in the `Business_Attributes` table where `attribute_id = 1` and `attribute_value = 'beer_and_wine'`. This will give us the number of businesses that sell both beer and wine.  6. **Write the SQL Query**:        SELECT COUNT(business_id)     FROM Business_Attributes     WHERE attribute_id = 1 AND attribute_value = 'beer_and_wine';        This query selects the count of business IDs that meet the criteria, effectively solving the problem.  7. **Verify the Solution**: Ensure the query aligns with the problem statement and schema. Double-check that the `attribute_id` and `attribute_value` used are correct and relevant to the context of selling beer and wine.  By following these steps, we logically arrive at the solution provided, ensuring it accurately addresses the problem using the given schema.",,
