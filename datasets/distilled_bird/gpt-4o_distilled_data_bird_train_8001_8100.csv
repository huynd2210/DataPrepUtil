The `university` table contains university names and their country IDs. The `university_year` table contains yearly data about universities, including the number of students and the percentage of international students.  2. **Identify Relevant Data**:    - We need to determine which tables contain the data necessary to calculate the number of international students. The `university_year` table has columns `num_students` and `pct_international_students`, which are crucial for this calculation.  3. **Calculate the Number of International Students**:    - For each university in a given year, calculate the number of international students using the formula:       \[      \text{num\_international\_students} = \left(\frac{\text{num\_students} \times \text{pct\_international\_students}}{100}\right)      \]    - This calculation gives the actual number of international students based on the total number of students and the percentage that are international.  4. **Rank Universities by International Students**:    - To find the top 5 universities, we need to rank them based on the calculated number of international students. This involves sorting the universities in descending order of international students.  5. **Select the Top 5 Universities**:    - After sorting, select the top 5 universities. This can be achieved using the SQL `LIMIT` clause.  6. **Retrieve University Names**:    - Since the `university_year` table does not contain university names, join it with the `university` table using the `university_id` to get the corresponding university names.  7. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Combine these steps into a SQL query:            SELECT DISTINCT T2.university_name       FROM university_year AS T1       INNER JOIN university AS T2 ON T1.university_id = T2.id       ORDER BY (CAST(T1.num_students * T1.pct_international_students AS REAL) / 100) DESC       LIMIT 5          - This query joins the `university_year` and `university` tables, calculates the number of international students, orders the results in descending order, and limits the output to the top 5 universities.

This means we need to find the average value of a specific column that represents the percentage of female students.  2. **Examine the Schema**: Review the provided schema to identify where the percentage of female students is recorded. The schema includes several tables: `country`, `ranking_system`, `ranking_criteria`, `university`, `university_ranking_year`, and `university_year`.  3. **Identify the Relevant Table and Column**:     - Upon examining the `university_year` table, we notice it contains a column named `pct_female_students`, which seems to directly represent the percentage of female students for each university in a given year.    - This column is likely the one we need to focus on to compute the average percentage.  4. **Consider the Data Context**:     - The `university_year` table contains data for different universities across various years. However, the problem does not specify any particular year or university, implying that we need to consider all available data.  5. **Handle Missing Data**:     - Notice that the `pct_female_students` column contains `None` values (or NULLs). When calculating the average, these NULL values should be ignored, as they do not contribute to the average calculation.  6. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - To compute the average, we use the SQL `AVG()` function, which automatically ignores NULL values in its calculation.    - The query should select the average of the `pct_female_students` column from the `university_year` table.  7. **Write the SQL Query**:    - The final SQL query is: `SELECT AVG(pct_female_students) FROM university_year;`    - This query will compute the average percentage of female students across all records in the `university_year` table, excluding any NULL values.

The goal is to find the score and the number of international students for a university with ID 100 in the year 2015. Here are the logical steps that could have been taken to reach the solution:  1. **Understand the Schema and Identify Relevant Tables:**    - Review the schema to understand the structure and relationships between tables.    - Identify the tables that contain information about universities, their rankings, and student demographics. The relevant tables are `university_year` and `university_ranking_year`.  2. **Identify Necessary Columns:**    - From the `university_year` table, we need the columns `num_students` and `pct_international_students` to calculate the number of international students.    - From the `university_ranking_year` table, we need the `score` column to get the ranking score.  3. **Determine the Join Condition:**    - Both `university_year` and `university_ranking_year` tables have the `university_id` column. This will be used to join the tables to combine relevant data for the same university.  4. **Filter Data for Specific Criteria:**    - We need data for the year 2015, so we will filter both tables for this year.    - We are interested in the university with ID 100, so we will filter for `university_id = 100`.  5. **Calculate the Number of International Students:**    - The number of international students can be calculated by multiplying `num_students` by `pct_international_students` and dividing by 100. This converts the percentage into an actual count.  6. **Construct the SQL Query:**    - Use a `SELECT` statement to retrieve the calculated number of international students and the score.    - Use an `INNER JOIN` to combine data from `university_year` and `university_ranking_year` based on `university_id`.    - Apply the `WHERE` clause to filter for the year 2015 and university ID 100.  7. **Final SQL Query:**    - The query is constructed as follows:            SELECT CAST(T1.num_students * T1.pct_international_students AS REAL) / 100, T2.score      FROM university_year AS T1      INNER JOIN university_ranking_year AS T2 ON T1.university_id = T2.university_id      WHERE T2.year = 2015 AND T1.university_id = 100        By following these steps, we ensure that the query retrieves the correct data as per the problem requirements.",,

This can be done by multiplying `num_students` by `pct_female_students` and dividing by 100 to convert the percentage to a decimal.  5. **Handle Missing Data**: Notice that the `pct_female_students` column may contain `None` (or null) values.

Here's a breakdown of the thought process:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: We need to find the most famous university in Argentina. In this context, ""most famous"" can be interpreted as the university with the highest cumulative score across various ranking criteria.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**:     - The `country` table will help us filter universities located in Argentina.    - The `university` table contains information about universities, including their country association.    - The `university_ranking_year` table provides scores for universities based on different ranking criteria.  3. **Determine Necessary Joins**:    - To link universities to their countries, we need to join the `university` table with the `country` table using the `country_id`.    - To access the ranking scores, we need to join the `university` table with the `university_ranking_year` table using the `university_id`.  4. **Filter for Argentina**:    - Use a `WHERE` clause to filter the results to only include universities located in Argentina. This is done by checking the `country_name` in the `country` table.  5. **Aggregate Scores**:    - Since we want to determine the ""most famous"" university, we need to aggregate the scores from the `university_ranking_year` table. The `SUM` function will be used to calculate the total score for each university.  6. **Order and Limit Results**:    - To identify the university with the highest score, order the results by the aggregated score in descending order.    - Use `LIMIT 1` to select only the top university based on the highest total score.  7. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Combine all the above steps into a coherent SQL query. This involves selecting the university name, performing the necessary joins, applying the filter for Argentina, grouping by university name, ordering by the sum of scores, and limiting the result to the top entry.  By following these logical steps, we arrive at the solution:   SELECT T1.university_name  FROM university AS T1  INNER JOIN university_ranking_year AS T2 ON T1.id = T2.university_id  INNER JOIN country AS T3 ON T3.id = T1.country_id  WHERE T3.country_name = 'Argentina'  GROUP BY T1.university_name  ORDER BY SUM(T2.score) DESC  LIMIT 1;   This query effectively identifies the most famous university in Argentina based on the highest cumulative ranking score.",,

This requires identifying the relevant tables and columns that can provide information about universities and their associated countries.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**: From the schema, the `university` table contains information about universities, and the `country` table contains information about countries. We need to establish a relationship between these two tables to find universities in a specific country.  3. **Determine the Relationship Between Tables**:     - The `university` table has a `country_id` column, which likely references the `id` column in the `country` table. This relationship allows us to link universities to their respective countries.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - We need to count the number of universities in Argentina. To do this, we can use a `COUNT(*)` function to count all rows that meet our criteria.    - We will perform an `INNER JOIN` between the `university` table and the `country` table on the `country_id` and `id` columns, respectively, to link universities with their countries.  5. **Add a Condition to Filter for Argentina**:    - We need to filter the results to only include universities in Argentina. This can be done by adding a `WHERE` clause that specifies `country_name = 'Argentina'`.  6. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Combine all the above steps into a single SQL query:            SELECT COUNT(*)       FROM university AS T1       INNER JOIN country AS T2       ON T1.country_id = T2.id       WHERE T2.country_name = 'Argentina';        7. **Verify the Query**:    - Ensure that the query correctly counts the number of universities by checking the logic and the relationships used in the query.  By following these steps, we can logically arrive at the solution to count the number of universities in Argentina using the given database schema.",,

Here's how you might approach it:  1. **Understand the Problem**: The task is to find the country ID associated with the University of Tokyo. This involves identifying the correct table and column that contain this information.  2. **Review the Schema**: Examine the provided schema to understand the structure of the database and the relationships between tables. The relevant tables for this problem are likely to be the `university` table, which contains information about universities, and the `country` table, which contains country information.  3. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - The `university` table contains a `university_name` column and a `country_id` column. This suggests that it holds the information needed to map a university to its country.    - The `country` table contains `id` and `country_name` columns, which can be used to map country IDs to country names if needed.  4. **Formulate the Query**:    - Since the goal is to find the `country_id` for the University of Tokyo, focus on the `university` table.    - Use a `SELECT` statement to retrieve the `country_id` where the `university_name` matches ""University of Tokyo"".  5. **Write the SQL Query**:    - The query should select the `country_id` from the `university` table where `university_name` is ""University of Tokyo"".    - The SQL query would look like this:            SELECT country_id FROM university WHERE university_name = 'University of Tokyo';        6. **Verify the Solution**:    - Ensure that the query correctly retrieves the desired information by checking if the `university_name` column in the `university` table indeed contains ""University of Tokyo"" and that the `country_id` is correctly returned.

This requires identifying the relevant tables and columns that can provide information about universities and their associated countries.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**: From the schema, the `university` table contains information about universities, including a `country_id` that links each university to a country. The `country` table contains the `country_name` and `id`, which can be used to identify Denmark.  3. **Determine Necessary Joins**: To find universities in Denmark, we need to join the `university` table with the `country` table. This is because the `university` table contains the `country_id`, which needs to be matched with the `id` in the `country` table to retrieve the `country_name`.  4. **Formulate the Join Condition**: The join condition is based on matching the `country_id` from the `university` table with the `id` from the `country` table. This will allow us to associate each university with its corresponding country.  5. **Filter for Denmark**: Once the tables are joined, we need to filter the results to only include universities where the `country_name` is 'Denmark'. This is done using a `WHERE` clause.  6. **Select the Required Columns**: The final step is to select the `university_name` from the joined tables, as this is the information we need to list.  7. **Write the SQL Query**: Based on the above reasoning, the SQL query can be constructed as follows:        SELECT T1.university_name     FROM university AS T1     INNER JOIN country AS T2     ON T1.country_id = T2.id     WHERE T2.country_name = 'Denmark';      By following these logical steps, we ensure that the query accurately retrieves the desired information about universities located in Denmark.",,

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logical reasoning process to arrive at the solution:  1. **Understand the Schema and Problem Requirements:**    - We have multiple tables: `country`, `ranking_system`, `ranking_criteria`, `university`, `university_ranking_year`, and `university_year`.    - The problem focuses on the `ranking_criteria` and `university_ranking_year` tables to find scores related to the ""International"" criteria for the year 2016.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns:**    - `ranking_criteria` table has `criteria_name` which we need to filter for ""International"".    - `university_ranking_year` table contains `year` and `score`, which are crucial for filtering the year 2016 and scores above 80.    - `university` table is needed to retrieve the university names.  3. **Filter Data Based on Criteria and Year:**    - Join `ranking_criteria` with `university_ranking_year` on `ranking_criteria_id` to filter records where `criteria_name` is ""International"".    - Further filter these records to only include those from the year 2016.  4. **Calculate the Percentage of Universities with Scores Above 80:**    - Use a `CASE` statement within a `SUM` function to count universities with scores greater than 80.    - Calculate the total number of universities by using `COUNT(*)`.    - Divide the count of universities with scores above 80 by the total count to get the percentage.  5. **Identify the University with the Highest Score:**    - Among the filtered universities (scores above 80 in 2016), order them by `score` in descending order.    - Use `LIMIT 1` to select the university with the highest score.  6. **Write the SQL Query:**    - Use a subquery to find the university with the highest score.    - Combine the percentage calculation and the subquery result in the main query.  7. **Construct the Final SQL Query:**    - The final query combines the percentage calculation and the subquery to provide the required results.  Here's the final SQL query based on the above reasoning:   SELECT      CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN T2.score > 80 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) / COUNT(*) AS percentage_above_80,     (         SELECT T3.university_name          FROM ranking_criteria AS T1          INNER JOIN university_ranking_year AS T2 ON T1.id = T2.ranking_criteria_id          INNER JOIN university AS T3 ON T3.id = T2.university_id          WHERE T1.criteria_name = 'International'          AND T2.year = 2016          AND T2.score > 80          ORDER BY T2.score DESC          LIMIT 1     ) AS university_with_highest_score FROM      ranking_criteria AS T1  INNER JOIN      university_ranking_year AS T2 ON T1.id = T2.ranking_criteria_id  INNER JOIN      university AS T3 ON T3.id = T2.university_id  WHERE      T1.criteria_name = 'International'      AND T2.year = 2016;   This query effectively calculates the required percentage and identifies the university with the highest score under the specified conditions.",,

Here are the logical steps to reach the solution:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to find universities with more than 20,000 students in 2011.    - Among these universities, we need to identify those with an international student percentage greater than 25%.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - From the schema, the `university_year` table contains information about the number of students (`num_students`) and the percentage of international students (`pct_international_students`) for each university by year.    - The `year` column in the `university_year` table will help us filter the data for the year 2011.  3. **Filter Data by Year**:    - We need to focus on data from the year 2011. This can be achieved by filtering the `university_year` table where the `year` column equals 2011.  4. **Apply Conditions for Student Count and International Percentage**:    - We need to filter universities with more than 20,000 students. This is done by setting a condition where `num_students > 20000`.    - Additionally, we need to filter universities where the percentage of international students is greater than 25%. This is done by setting a condition where `pct_international_students > 25`.  5. **Count the Number of Universities Meeting the Criteria**:    - After applying the filters, we need to count the number of universities that meet both conditions. This can be achieved using the `COUNT(*)` function in SQL.  6. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Combine the conditions and the counting operation into a single SQL query:            SELECT COUNT(*)       FROM university_year       WHERE year = 2011         AND pct_international_students > 25         AND num_students > 20000;        By following these steps, we can effectively filter and count the universities that meet the specified criteria for the year 2011.",,

Here's a breakdown of the thought process:  1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to count the number of universities located in Turkey. This requires identifying which universities are associated with Turkey in the database.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**:     - The `university` table contains information about universities, including a `country_id` that links each university to a country.    - The `country` table contains country information, including the `country_name` and `id`.  3. **Determine the Relationship Between Tables**:    - The `university` table's `country_id` column corresponds to the `id` column in the `country` table. This relationship allows us to join these tables to find out which universities are in Turkey.  4. **Plan the SQL Query**:    - We need to join the `university` table with the `country` table on the `country_id` and `id` columns, respectively.    - We then filter the results to only include rows where the `country_name` is 'Turkey'.  5. **Select the Appropriate Columns**:    - Since we only need to count the number of Turkish universities, we don't need to select any specific columns from the tables. Instead, we use the `COUNT(*)` function to count the total number of matching rows.  6. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Use an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `university` and `country` tables based on the relationship between `country_id` and `id`.    - Apply a `WHERE` clause to filter the results to only include universities where the `country_name` is 'Turkey'.    - Use `COUNT(*)` to get the number of universities that meet this condition.  7. **Final SQL Query**:    - The final query is:             SELECT COUNT(*)       FROM university AS T1       INNER JOIN country AS T2       ON T1.country_id = T2.id       WHERE T2.country_name = 'Turkey';        By following these logical steps, we ensure that we accurately count the number of Turkish universities in the database.",,

Here's a breakdown of the thought process:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: We need to find the university with the highest number of students in the year 2011. The output should be the name of the university.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - The `university_year` table contains information about the number of students (`num_students`) and the year (`year`).    - The `university` table contains the names of the universities (`university_name`).  3. **Determine the Relationship Between Tables**:    - The `university_year` table has a `university_id` column that can be used to join with the `id` column in the `university` table to get the university names.  4. **Filter for the Specific Year**:    - We need data specifically for the year 2011. Therefore, we should filter the `university_year` table to include only records where `year = 2011`.  5. **Sort to Find the Maximum**:    - To find the university with the most students, we need to sort the filtered results by `num_students` in descending order.

Here's how you can approach the problem:  1. **Understand the Schema and Relationships:**    - Identify the relevant tables: `ranking_criteria`, `university`, `university_ranking_year`.    - Understand the relationships between these tables:      - `ranking_criteria` provides the criteria names and is linked to `university_ranking_year` through `ranking_criteria_id`.      - `university` provides the university names and is linked to `university_ranking_year` through `university_id`.  2. **Identify the Target University and Year:**    - We are interested in the University of Southampton for the year 2015.    - Locate the university in the `university` table using the `university_name` column.  3. **Filter the Data:**    - Use the `university_ranking_year` table to filter records where the `university_id` corresponds to the University of Southampton and the `year` is 2015.  4. **Join Tables to Gather Necessary Information:**    - Perform an INNER JOIN between `ranking_criteria` and `university_ranking_year` on `ranking_criteria_id` to get the criteria names associated with each score.    - Perform another INNER JOIN between the result and the `university` table on `university_id` to ensure we are only considering scores for the University of Southampton.  5. **Sort and Select the Best Score:**    - Order the results by the `score` column in descending order to prioritize higher scores.    - Use `LIMIT 1` to select the top record, which corresponds to the highest score for the University of Southampton in 2015.  6. **Formulate the SQL Query:**    - Based on the above steps, construct the SQL query to extract the desired information:            SELECT T1.criteria_name      FROM ranking_criteria AS T1      INNER JOIN university_ranking_year AS T2 ON T1.id = T2.ranking_criteria_id      INNER JOIN university AS T3 ON T3.id = T2.university_id      WHERE T3.university_name = 'University of Southampton' AND T2.year = 2015      ORDER BY T2.score DESC      LIMIT 1;        By following these logical steps, you can systematically approach the problem and derive the solution effectively.",,

This means we need to look into the relationship between ranking systems and their criteria.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**: From the schema, we identify that the `ranking_system` and `ranking_criteria` tables are relevant. The `ranking_system` table contains information about different ranking systems, and the `ranking_criteria` table contains criteria associated with these systems.  3. **Determine the Relationship**: The `ranking_criteria` table has a foreign key `ranking_system_id` that links it to the `ranking_system` table. This relationship allows us to connect criteria to their respective ranking systems.  4. **Formulate the Query**:    - We need to select the `system_name` from the `ranking_system` table where the criteria name in the `ranking_criteria` table is ""Total Shanghai.""    - To achieve this, we perform an INNER JOIN between the `ranking_system` and `ranking_criteria` tables on the `id` and `ranking_system_id` columns, respectively.  5. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Use the SELECT statement to retrieve the `system_name`.    - Use INNER JOIN to combine the `ranking_system` and `ranking_criteria` tables.    - Add a WHERE clause to filter the results to only include rows where `criteria_name` is ""Total Shanghai.""  6. **Execute and Verify**: Run the query to ensure it returns the correct ranking system name associated with the ""Total Shanghai"" criteria.  By following these steps, we arrive at the solution:   SELECT T1.system_name  FROM ranking_system AS T1  INNER JOIN ranking_criteria AS T2  ON T1.id = T2.ranking_system_id  WHERE T2.criteria_name = 'Total Shanghai';   This query effectively retrieves the name of the ranking system that includes the ""Total Shanghai"" criteria.",,
