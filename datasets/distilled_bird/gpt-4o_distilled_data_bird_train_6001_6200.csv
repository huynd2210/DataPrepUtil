The `cust_order` table contains information about orders, including the `shipping_method_id`. The `shipping_method` table contains details about each shipping method, including `method_id` and `method_name`.  2. **Determine the Relationship Between Tables:**    - Recognize that the `cust_order` table can be joined with the `shipping_method` table using the `shipping_method_id` from `cust_order` and `method_id` from `shipping_method`. This relationship allows us to associate each order with its corresponding shipping method name.  3. **Count the Frequency of Each Shipping Method:**    - Use an SQL query to count how many times each shipping method is used in the `cust_order` table. This can be achieved by grouping the results by `method_name` and using the `COUNT()` function to determine the frequency of each method.  4. **Sort the Shipping Methods by Frequency:**    - Once the frequencies are calculated, sort the shipping methods in ascending order based on their count. This will allow us to identify the least common methods first.  5. **Select the Second-Least Common Method:**    - After sorting, the second-least common method will be the second entry in the sorted list. Use the `LIMIT` clause to skip the first entry and select the second one. In SQL, this is typically done using `LIMIT 1, 1`, which skips the first result and returns the second.  6. **Formulate the SQL Query:**    - Combine the above steps into a single SQL query. Use an `INNER JOIN` to combine `cust_order` and `shipping_method` tables, `GROUP BY` to count the occurrences of each method, `ORDER BY` to sort them by frequency, and `LIMIT` to select the second-least common method.  By following these steps, you can logically derive the solution to the problem, which is expressed in the SQL query provided:   SELECT T2.method_name  FROM cust_order AS T1  INNER JOIN shipping_method AS T2 ON T1.shipping_method_id = T2.method_id  GROUP BY T2.method_name  ORDER BY COUNT(T2.method_id) ASC  LIMIT 1, 1;   This query effectively finds the second-least common shipping method by counting, sorting, and selecting the appropriate entry.",,

Here's how you can approach it:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: We need to find out how many customer addresses are marked as inactive. This requires us to identify the relevant tables and columns that store information about customer addresses and their status.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**:     - The `customer_address` table contains information about customer addresses, including a `status_id` that indicates the status of each address.    - The `address_status` table contains the mapping of `status_id` to human-readable status descriptions such as ""Active"" or ""Inactive"".  3. **Determine the Relationship Between Tables**:     - There is a relationship between `customer_address` and `address_status` through the `status_id` column. This allows us to join these tables to get the status description for each address.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - We need to count the number of addresses that have a status of ""Inactive"". This requires filtering the results based on the `address_status` being ""Inactive"".    - To achieve this, we perform an INNER JOIN between `customer_address` and `address_status` on the `status_id` column.    - We then apply a WHERE clause to filter for rows where `address_status` is ""Inactive"".  5. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Start with a SELECT statement to count the number of rows.    - Use an INNER JOIN to combine `customer_address` and `address_status` on `status_id`.    - Apply a WHERE clause to filter for `address_status = 'Inactive'`.  6. **Verify the Query**:    - Ensure that the query correctly counts only those addresses with the status ""Inactive"".    - Double-check the column names and table names to ensure accuracy.  By following these steps, we arrive at the solution:   SELECT COUNT(*)  FROM customer_address AS T1  INNER JOIN address_status AS T2  ON T1.status_id = T2.status_id  WHERE T2.address_status = 'Inactive';   This query will return the count of customer addresses that are marked as inactive, which is the solution to the problem.",,

This involves counting the number of orders for each book and identifying the one with the highest count.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**: From the schema, the tables that are relevant to this problem are:    - `order_line`: This table contains information about each order line, including the `book_id` and `order_id`.    - `book`: This table contains information about each book, including the `book_id` and `title`.  3. **Determine the Relationship**: The `order_line` table links orders to books through the `book_id`. We need to aggregate data from this table to count how many times each book appears in orders.  4. **Formulate the Query**:    - **Select the Book Title**: We are interested in the title of the book, so we need to join the `order_line` table with the `book` table to access the `title` column.    - **Join Tables**: Use an INNER JOIN to combine `order_line` and `book` on the `book_id` column to get the title associated with each order line.    - **Group and Count**: Group the results by `book.title` to aggregate the order lines for each book. Use the `COUNT()` function to count the number of times each book appears in the `order_line` table.    - **Order by Count**: Sort the grouped results in descending order based on the count to bring the book with the most orders to the top.    - **Limit the Results**: Use `LIMIT 1` to return only the book with the highest count.  5. **Construct the SQL Query**:        SELECT T2.title    FROM order_line AS T1    INNER JOIN book AS T2 ON T1.book_id = T2.book_id    GROUP BY T2.title    ORDER BY COUNT(T1.book_id) DESC    LIMIT 1;      6. **Verify the Query**: Ensure that the query correctly identifies the book with the most orders by checking the logic and considering edge cases, such as ties in the number of orders.  By following these steps, we can logically construct the SQL query to solve the problem of finding the book with the most orders.",,

Here’s a breakdown of the reasoning process:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement:**    - We need to identify the address that has received the most orders. This implies counting the number of orders associated with each address and determining which address has the highest count.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns:**    - The `cust_order` table is crucial because it contains information about orders, specifically the `dest_address_id` column, which indicates the destination address for each order.    - The `address` table is also relevant because it contains details about each address, such as `street_name`, `city`, and `address_id`.  3. **Determine the Relationships:**    - There is a direct relationship between the `cust_order` table and the `address` table through the `dest_address_id` and `address_id` columns, respectively. This relationship allows us to join these tables to get detailed address information for each order.  4. **Plan the SQL Query:**    - **Join Tables:** Use an INNER JOIN to combine `cust_order` and `address` tables on the matching `dest_address_id` and `address_id` columns to get the full address details for each order.    - **Group and Count Orders:** Group the results by address details (`street_number`, `street_name`, `city`) and count the number of orders for each group. This will help us determine the number of orders associated with each address.    - **Order by Count:** Sort the grouped results in descending order based on the count of orders to identify which address has the most orders.    - **Limit the Results:** Use a LIMIT clause to return only the top result, which corresponds to the address with the highest order count.  5. **Construct the SQL Query:**    - The SQL query should select the `street_name` and `city` from the `address` table, join with the `cust_order` table, group by the address details, order by the count of orders in descending order, and limit the result to one.   SELECT T2.street_name, T2.city  FROM cust_order AS T1  INNER JOIN address AS T2 ON T1.dest_address_id = T2.address_id  GROUP BY T2.street_number, T2.street_name, T2.city  ORDER BY COUNT(T1.dest_address_id) DESC  LIMIT 1;   6. **Verify the Solution:**    - Ensure that the query correctly identifies the address with the most orders by checking the logic of the join, grouping, and ordering. The use of `LIMIT 1` ensures that only the top result is returned.  By following these logical steps, we can construct a SQL query that accurately identifies the address with the most orders from the given database schema.",,

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to find the customer with the most addresses. This implies counting the number of addresses associated with each customer and identifying the customer with the highest count.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**:    - From the schema, the `customer` table contains customer details, and the `customer_address` table links customers to their addresses. The `customer_address` table is crucial because it contains the `customer_id` and `address_id`, which allows us to count how many addresses are linked to each customer.  3. **Determine the Required Columns**:    - To identify the customer, we need the `first_name` and `last_name` from the `customer` table.     - The `customer_id` from both the `customer` and `customer_address` tables will be used to join these tables.  4. **Plan the SQL Query**:    - **Join the Tables**: Use an INNER JOIN to combine the `customer` and `customer_address` tables on the `customer_id` column. This will allow us to associate each address with its respective customer.    - **Group and Count**: Group the results by `first_name` and `last_name` to aggregate the addresses for each customer. Use the COUNT function to count the number of addresses for each customer.    - **Order the Results**: Order the results in descending order of the count to bring the customer with the most addresses to the top.    - **Limit the Output**: Use LIMIT 1 to return only the customer with the highest count.  5. **Write the SQL Query**:    - The query is constructed as follows:            SELECT T1.first_name, T1.last_name      FROM customer AS T1      INNER JOIN customer_address AS T2 ON T1.customer_id = T2.customer_id      GROUP BY T1.first_name, T1.last_name      ORDER BY COUNT(T2.customer_id) DESC      LIMIT 1;          - This query selects the first and last names of customers, joins the `customer` and `customer_address` tables, groups the results by customer name, orders them by the count of addresses in descending order, and limits the output to the top result.  6. **Verify the Solution**:    - Ensure the query logic aligns with the problem statement and schema. Check that the join condition is correct, the grouping and ordering are appropriately applied, and the limit is set to return only the top result.  By following these steps, we systematically derive the solution to identify the customer with the most addresses using the given schema.",,

Here, the `cust_order` table contains information about orders, including the `shipping_method_id`. The `order_line` table contains the `price` of each order line, and the `shipping_method` table contains the `method_name` which indicates if the shipping is 'International'.  2. **Identify Relevant Columns**:    - From the `cust_order` table, we need `order_id` and `shipping_method_id`.    - From the `order_line` table, we need `order_id` and `price`.    - From the `shipping_method` table, we need `method_id` and `method_name`.  3. **Join Tables to Gather Necessary Data**:    - Join `cust_order` with `order_line` on `order_id` to link orders with their prices.    - Join the result with `shipping_method` on `method_id` to get the shipping method name for each order.  4. **Filter and Calculate International Orders**:    - Use a `CASE` statement to filter orders where `method_name` is 'International'. This will help in calculating the sum of prices for international orders.  5. **Calculate Total Prices**:    - Calculate the total sum of prices for all orders. This will be the denominator in our percentage calculation.  6. **Calculate Total Prices for International Orders**:    - Calculate the sum of prices for orders that are shipped internationally using the `CASE` statement.  7. **Compute the Percentage**:    - Divide the sum of international order prices by the total sum of all order prices and multiply by 100 to get the percentage.  8. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Formulate the SQL query using the above logic to get the desired result.  Here's how the SQL query is structured based on these steps:   SELECT      CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN T3.method_name = 'International' THEN T2.price ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) * 100 / SUM(T2.price)  FROM      cust_order AS T1  INNER JOIN      order_line AS T2 ON T1.order_id = T2.order_id  INNER JOIN      shipping_method AS T3 ON T3.method_id = T1.shipping_method_id;   This query calculates the percentage of the total order prices that are shipped internationally by summing up the prices of international orders and dividing by the total sum of all order prices.",,

Here's how we can approach the problem:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to find the lowest non-zero price paid by a customer for an order. This involves identifying the relevant table and column that store the price information.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - From the provided schema, identify which table contains information about order prices. The `order_line` table contains a `price` column, which is likely where the price of each order line item is stored.  3. **Clarify the Requirement**:    - The task is to find the minimum price that is greater than zero. This means we need to exclude any zero values from our consideration.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - To find the minimum price that is not zero, we can use the SQL `MIN()` function, which returns the smallest value in a set.    - We need to add a condition to exclude zero prices. This can be done using a `WHERE` clause.  5. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - The query should select the minimum price from the `order_line` table where the price is not zero. This translates to:            SELECT MIN(price) FROM order_line WHERE price <> 0;        6. **Verify the Query**:    - Ensure that the query correctly identifies the minimum non-zero price by considering edge cases, such as when all prices are zero or when there are multiple non-zero prices.  7. **Consider Performance and Optimization**:    - Although not explicitly required, consider the performance of the query. Since we're using an aggregate function (`MIN()`), the query should perform efficiently on indexed columns.  By following these steps, we can logically arrive at the solution to find the lowest non-zero price paid by a customer for an order.",,

Mail e-mail address, follow these logical steps:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - The task is to determine the number of customers who have a Yahoo! Mail e-mail address. This involves identifying customers whose e-mail addresses end with a specific domain, in this case, ""@yahoo.com"".  2. **Review the Schema**:    - Examine the provided schema to identify which table contains information about customers and their e-mail addresses.     - The `customer` table is identified as the relevant table because it includes columns for `customer_id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, and `email`.  3. **Identify the Relevant Column**:    - Focus on the `email` column within the `customer` table, as it contains the e-mail addresses of customers.  4. **Determine the Filtering Criteria**:    - Since we are interested in Yahoo! Mail addresses, the filtering criterion is that the e-mail address should end with ""@yahoo.com"".    - Use the SQL `LIKE` operator to filter e-mail addresses that match this pattern. The pattern to match is '%@yahoo.com', where '%' is a wildcard representing any sequence of characters before '@yahoo.com'.  5. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Construct a SQL query to count the number of rows in the `customer` table where the `email` column matches the specified pattern.    - The SQL query is: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customer WHERE email LIKE '%@yahoo.com'`.  6. **Execute and Validate**:    - Execute the query to retrieve the count of customers with Yahoo! Mail addresses.    - Validate the results to ensure the query accurately reflects the problem requirements and that the count is correct.  By following these steps, you arrive at the solution to count the number of customers using a Yahoo! Mail e-mail address.",,

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process:  1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to count the number of orders placed by a specific customer (Marcelia Goering) in the year 2021, where the shipping method was Priority.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**: Based on the schema, the relevant tables for this query are:    - `customer`: To identify the customer by name.    - `cust_order`: To find the orders placed by the customer and the date of those orders.    - `shipping_method`: To determine the shipping method used for each order.  3. **Determine Necessary Joins**:    - Join `customer` with `cust_order` on `customer_id` to link customers to their orders.    - Join `cust_order` with `shipping_method` on `shipping_method_id` to get the shipping method details for each order.  4. **Filter Criteria**:    - Filter by the customer's first and last name to ensure we are only considering orders placed by Marcelia Goering.    - Extract the year from the `order_date` in `cust_order` to filter orders placed in 2021.    - Filter by the `method_name` in `shipping_method` to only include orders with the Priority shipping method.  5. **Count the Orders**: Use the `COUNT(*)` function to count the number of orders that meet all the specified criteria.  6. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Start with the `SELECT COUNT(*)` to count the number of matching records.    - Use `INNER JOIN` to join the `customer`, `cust_order`, and `shipping_method` tables based on the identified keys.    - Apply `WHERE` conditions to filter by customer name, order year, and shipping method.  Here's the final SQL query based on these steps:   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customer AS T1 INNER JOIN cust_order AS T2 ON T1.customer_id = T2.customer_id INNER JOIN shipping_method AS T3 ON T3.method_id = T2.shipping_method_id WHERE T1.first_name = 'Marcelia'   AND T1.last_name = 'Goering'   AND STRFTIME('%Y', T2.order_date) = '2021'   AND T3.method_name = 'Priority';   By following these logical steps, we ensure that the query accurately counts the number of orders placed by Marcelia Goering in 2021 using the Priority Shipping method.",,

By following these steps, we can logically arrive at the solution to the problem of finding the book with the most expensive price.",,

Here's how we can approach the problem:  1. **Identify the Target Information**: We need to find out how many customers ordered a specific book titled ""Anleitung zum Zickigsein.""  2. **Locate the Book Title**:     - Look for a table that contains book information, including titles. From the schema, the `book` table is the appropriate choice as it contains a `title` column.  3. **Find Orders Related to the Book**:    - To determine which orders include the book, we need to find a table that links books to orders. The `order_line` table serves this purpose as it contains `book_id` and `order_id`, linking books to specific orders.  4. **Establish the Relationship Between Books and Orders**:    - Perform an INNER JOIN between the `book` table and the `order_line` table using the `book_id` column. This will allow us to filter orders that include the specific book by its title.  5. **Filter by Book Title**:    - Use a WHERE clause to filter the results of the join operation to only include rows where the `title` is ""Anleitung zum Zickigsein.""  6. **Count the Number of Orders**:    - Since the problem asks for the number of customers who ordered the book, and each order is associated with a customer, we can count the number of rows returned by the join operation after filtering by the book title. This will give us the number of orders that include the book.  7. **Write the SQL Query**:    - The SQL query that implements these steps is:            SELECT COUNT(*)      FROM book AS T1      INNER JOIN order_line AS T2 ON T1.book_id = T2.book_id      WHERE T1.title = 'Anleitung zum Zickigsein'        8. **Verify the Solution**:    - Ensure that the query correctly counts the number of orders for the specified book title by checking the logic and the relationships used in the join.  By following these logical steps, we can effectively navigate the schema and construct a query to solve the problem.",,

This will allow us to access both the book title and the price paid in the same query.    - **Filter for the Specific Book**: Use a WHERE clause to filter the results to only include rows where the `title` is ""Bite Me If You Can (Argeneau #6)"".    - **Find the Maximum Price**: Use the MAX() function to find the highest price from the filtered results.  6. **Write the SQL Query**:        SELECT MAX(T2.price)    FROM book AS T1    INNER JOIN order_line AS T2 ON T1.book_id = T2.book_id    WHERE T1.title = 'Bite Me If You Can (Argeneau #6)'      7. **Verify the Solution**: Ensure that the query correctly identifies the maximum price paid for the specified book by checking the logic and testing the query against the database.  By following these steps, you can logically derive the solution to the problem and ensure that the SQL query accurately retrieves the desired information.",,

This involves identifying the oldest book based on its publication date and then counting the number of orders for that book.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - **book**: We need the `publication_date` to determine the oldest book.    - **order_line**: This table links books to orders via `book_id` and `order_id`.    - **cust_order**: This table links orders to customers via `order_id` and `customer_id`.  3. **Determine the Oldest Book**:    - Use the `book` table to find the book with the earliest `publication_date`. This can be done by ordering the books by `publication_date` in ascending order.  4. **Link the Oldest Book to Orders**:    - Use the `order_line` table to find all orders that include the oldest book. This involves joining the `book` table with the `order_line` table on `book_id`.  5. **Count the Number of Orders for the Oldest Book**:    - After identifying the orders that include the oldest book, count these orders. This can be achieved by grouping the results by `publication_date` and using the `COUNT(*)` function.  6. **Limit the Result to the Oldest Book**:    - Since we are only interested in the oldest book, limit the result to the first entry after ordering by `publication_date`.  7. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Combine the above steps into a SQL query:            SELECT COUNT(*)      FROM book AS T1      INNER JOIN order_line AS T2 ON T1.book_id = T2.book_id      GROUP BY T1.publication_date      ORDER BY T1.publication_date ASC      LIMIT 1;          - This query joins the `book` and `order_line` tables on `book_id`, groups the results by `publication_date`, orders them to find the oldest book, and limits the result to the first entry to get the count of orders for the oldest book.

Here's a breakdown of the thought process:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: We need to find out how many customers ordered Stephen King's first book. This involves identifying Stephen King's books, determining which one was published first, and counting the customers who ordered that specific book.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**: Based on the schema provided, the relevant tables for this query are:    - `author`: To find the author_id for Stephen King.    - `book_author`: To link books to Stephen King using author_id.    - `book`: To determine the publication date of Stephen King's books and identify the first one.    - `order_line`: To find orders that include the first book.    - `cust_order`: To link orders to customers.  3. **Find Stephen King's Author ID**:     - Query the `author` table to get the `author_id` for Stephen King.  4. **Identify Books by Stephen King**:    - Use the `book_author` table to find all `book_id`s associated with Stephen King's `author_id`.  5. **Determine the First Book**:    - Join the `book` table with the `book_author` table to get the publication dates of Stephen King's books.    - Order these books by `publication_date` in ascending order to identify the first book.    - Use `LIMIT 1` to select only the first book.  6. **Find Orders for the First Book**:    - Use the `order_line` table to find all `order_id`s where the `book_id` matches the first book identified in the previous step.  7. **Count Unique Customers**:    - Join the `cust_order` table with the `order_line` table to link orders to customers.    - Count the distinct `customer_id`s associated with orders for the first book.  8. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Combine all these steps into a single SQL query that joins the necessary tables and applies the appropriate conditions and aggregations.  Here is how the SQL query is constructed based on these steps:   SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT T5.customer_id) FROM book AS T1 INNER JOIN book_author AS T2 ON T1.book_id = T2.book_id INNER JOIN author AS T3 ON T3.author_id = T2.author_id INNER JOIN order_line AS T4 ON T4.book_id = T1.book_id INNER JOIN cust_order AS T5 ON T5.order_id = T4.order_id WHERE T3.author_name = 'Stephen King' ORDER BY T1.publication_date ASC LIMIT 1;   This query counts the distinct customers who ordered Stephen King's first published book by joining the relevant tables and applying the necessary filters and ordering.",,

Here's how we can approach the problem:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: We need to find the languages of the first two books published.

By following these steps, we can logically construct the SQL query that provides the solution:   SELECT T2.language_name  FROM book AS T1  INNER JOIN book_language AS T2  ON T1.language_id = T2.language_id  ORDER BY T1.publication_date ASC  LIMIT 2;   This query effectively retrieves the language names of the first two books published, fulfilling the requirements of the problem statement.",,

Here are the steps:  1. **Identify Relevant Tables:**    - From the schema, identify the tables that are likely to contain the necessary information. Since we are looking for the publisher of a book, the relevant tables are `book` and `publisher`.  2. **Understand Table Relationships:**    - Determine how these tables are related. The `book` table contains a `publisher_id` column, which can be used to join with the `publisher` table to get the `publisher_name`.  3. **Locate the Book Title:**    - Focus on the `book` table to find the record for ""The Secret Garden."" The `title` column in the `book` table will be used to filter for this specific book.  4. **Join Tables:**    - Use an SQL JOIN operation to combine the `book` and `publisher` tables. Specifically, use an INNER JOIN on the `publisher_id` column, which is common to both tables, to link each book with its corresponding publisher.  5. **Select the Desired Information:**    - After joining the tables, select the `publisher_name` from the `publisher` table, as this is the information we need.  6. **Filter for Specific Book:**    - Apply a WHERE clause to filter the results to only include the book titled ""The Secret Garden.""  7. **Ensure Unique Results:**    - Use the DISTINCT keyword to ensure that the result set contains unique publisher names, in case there are multiple entries for the same book title.  By following these logical steps, we can construct the SQL query to find the publisher of ""The Secret Garden"":   SELECT DISTINCT T2.publisher_name  FROM book AS T1  INNER JOIN publisher AS T2  ON T1.publisher_id = T2.publisher_id  WHERE T1.title = 'The Secret Garden';   This query effectively retrieves the publisher name for the specified book by leveraging the relationships and data stored in the `book` and `publisher` tables.",,

Rowling',"To solve the problem of finding out how many books published by Scholastic were written by J.K. Rowling, we can follow these logical steps:  1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to count the number of books that were published by Scholastic and authored by J.K. Rowling. This requires us to identify the relevant tables and columns in the database schema.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**:     - The `book` table contains information about books, including the `publisher_id`.    - The `publisher` table contains information about publishers, including the `publisher_name`.    - The `book_author` table links books to their authors through `book_id` and `author_id`.    - The `author` table contains information about authors, including the `author_name`.  3. **Determine Necessary Joins**:    - We need to join the `book` table with the `publisher` table to filter books published by Scholastic. This is done using the `publisher_id`.    - We need to join the `book` table with the `book_author` table to link books to their authors.    - We need to join the `book_author` table with the `author` table to filter authors by the name J.K. Rowling.  4. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Start with the `SELECT COUNT(*)` statement to count the number of books.    - Use `INNER JOIN` to connect the `book` table with the `publisher` table on `publisher_id`.    - Use `INNER JOIN` to connect the `book` table with the `book_author` table on `book_id`.    - Use `INNER JOIN` to connect the `book_author` table with the `author` table on `author_id`.    - Add a `WHERE` clause to filter the results where the `publisher_name` is 'Scholastic' and the `author_name` is 'J.K. Rowling'.  5. **Verify the Solution**:    - Ensure that the query logic correctly reflects the problem statement.    - Check that all necessary tables and columns are included in the query.    - Confirm that the joins are correctly linking the tables to filter the desired records.  By following these steps, we can construct a query that accurately counts the number of books published by Scholastic and written by J.K. Rowling.",,

In this case, the `book` table and the `publisher` table are of interest.    - The `book` table contains information about each book, including the `publisher_id`.    - The `publisher` table contains information about each publisher, including the `publisher_name`.  2. **Identify the Relationship**:    - Recognize that the `book` table and the `publisher` table are related through the `publisher_id` column. This column acts as a foreign key in the `book` table, linking each book to its corresponding publisher.  3. **Formulate the Query**:    - Start by selecting the necessary columns. We need the `publisher_name` from the `publisher` table.    - Use an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `book` and `publisher` tables based on the `publisher_id`. This will allow us to access the publisher's name for each book.  4. **Group and Aggregate**:    - Use the `GROUP BY` clause to group the results by `publisher_name`. This is necessary to count the number of books each publisher has published.    - Use the `COUNT` function to count the number of books associated with each publisher.  5. **Apply the Condition**:    - Use the `HAVING` clause to filter the groups based on the count of books. Specifically, we want only those publishers who have published at least 30 books.    - The condition `HAVING COUNT(T2.publisher_name) >= 30` ensures that only publishers with 30 or more books are included in the result.  6. **Execute and Verify**:    - Execute the query to retrieve the desired results.    - Verify the output to ensure it meets the problem's requirements.  By following these steps, we construct the SQL query that accurately identifies publishers who have published at least 30 books. The final query is:   SELECT T2.publisher_name  FROM book AS T1  INNER JOIN publisher AS T2  ON T1.publisher_id = T2.publisher_id  GROUP BY T2.publisher_name  HAVING COUNT(T2.publisher_name) >= 30;",,

This implies that we need to extract the street numbers from the addresses.  2. **Analyze the Schema**: Review the schema to identify which table contains information about streets and their numbers. From the schema, the `address` table contains columns `street_number` and `street_name`, which are relevant to our task.  3. **Identify Relevant Columns**: Focus on the `street_number` column from the `address` table since it contains the numerical part of the street address that we are interested in.  4. **Determine the SQL Query**: Since the problem asks for the last number of each street, and given the simplicity of the solution, it seems the task is to simply list all street numbers. The problem statement might be interpreted as needing to list all street numbers, as there is no specific requirement for aggregation or filtering.  5. **Formulate the SQL Query**: Based on the understanding that we need to list street numbers, the SQL query would be:        SELECT street_number FROM address;      6. **Review the Solution**: Ensure that the solution aligns with the problem statement. The query retrieves all street numbers from the `address` table, which matches the requirement to indicate the last number of each street.  7. **Consider Edge Cases**: Although the problem statement is straightforward, consider if there are any additional requirements or edge cases, such as needing to find the maximum street number per street name. However, based on the provided solution, such considerations are not necessary.

Here is a breakdown of those steps:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to find the complete address of customers who are located in the city of Lazaro Cardenas.  2. **Analyze the Schema**:    - Review the tables provided in the schema to identify which ones contain relevant information about addresses and customers.    - The `address` table contains columns like `street_number`, `street_name`, `city`, and `country_id`, which are directly related to the address information we need.    - The `customer_address` table links customers to their addresses through `customer_id` and `address_id`.  3. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - The `address` table is crucial as it contains the city information (`city` column) and other address details (`street_number`, `street_name`, `country_id`).    - We are specifically interested in the rows where the `city` is Lazaro Cardenas.  4. **Formulate the Query**:    - Since the problem only asks for the complete address information and not any customer details, we can directly query the `address` table.    - We need to select the columns that constitute a complete address: `street_number`, `street_name`, `city`, and `country_id`.  5. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Construct a SQL query to select the necessary columns from the `address` table where the `city` is Lazaro Cardenas.    - The query should look like this:            SELECT street_number, street_name, city, country_id       FROM address       WHERE city = 'Lazaro Cardenas';        6. **Verify the Solution**:    - Ensure that the query accurately retrieves the complete address information for the specified city.    - Check if any additional conditions or joins are necessary. In this case, since we only need the address details, no joins with the `customer_address` or `customer` tables are required.  By following these logical steps, we can confidently arrive at the solution to the given SQL problem.",,

Here’s a breakdown of the thought process:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to find the ISBN13 of books that have a specific range of pages, specifically less than 140 pages and more than 135 pages.  2. **Identify Relevant Table**:    - From the provided schema, identify which table contains information about books. The `book` table is relevant because it includes columns such as `isbn13` and `num_pages`, which are directly related to the problem.  3. **Focus on Relevant Columns**:    - Within the `book` table, the columns of interest are `isbn13` and `num_pages`. `isbn13` is the identifier we need to select, and `num_pages` is the attribute we need to filter on.  4. **Formulate the Filtering Condition**:    - The problem specifies a range for the number of pages: less than 140 and more than 135. This translates to the condition `num_pages < 140 AND num_pages > 135`.  5. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Using the identified table and columns, construct a SQL query that selects the `isbn13` from the `book` table where the `num_pages` meet the specified condition.  6. **Verify the Query**:    - Ensure that the query logically aligns with the problem statement and that it will return the correct results based on the given conditions.  By following these steps, we arrive at the SQL query:  SELECT isbn13 FROM book WHERE num_pages < 140 AND num_pages > 135;   This query selects the ISBN13 of books that have a number of pages between 136 and 139, inclusive, effectively solving the problem as stated.",,

Here are the logical steps that could have been taken to reach the solution:  1. **Understand the Problem Context**:     - The problem asks for books with the greatest potential value as collectibles. Collectible books are often those that are older, rare, or have historical significance.  2. **Identify Relevant Data**:    - From the given schema, the `book` table is the most relevant as it contains information about books, including their `title`, `publication_date`, and other attributes.  3. **Determine Key Attributes**:    - The `publication_date` is a critical attribute because older books are often more valuable as collectibles. The `title` is needed for the final output.  4. **Formulate a Hypothesis**:    - Older books might have a higher potential value as collectibles due to their rarity and historical significance.  5. **Plan the Query**:    - We need to retrieve the titles of the books and sort them by their publication date in ascending order to identify the oldest books.  6. **Implement the Query**:    - Construct an SQL query to select the `title` from the `book` table, order the results by `publication_date` in ascending order, and limit the results to the top six.  7. **Write the SQL Query**:    - The SQL query is: `SELECT title FROM book ORDER BY publication_date ASC LIMIT 6`.  8. **Verify and Validate**:    - Ensure that the query correctly retrieves the titles of the six oldest books, which are likely to have the greatest potential value as collectibles based on the assumption that age correlates with collectible value.  By following these logical steps, we can derive the solution to the problem by focusing on the attributes that contribute to a book's collectible value, primarily its age, and using SQL to extract and sort the relevant data accordingly.",,

Here's how you can approach this:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to find the number of books ordered in December 2020. This involves identifying orders placed during this specific time frame.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**:    - From the schema, the `cust_order` table is crucial because it contains information about orders, including the `order_date`.  3. **Determine the Necessary Information**:    - We need to filter orders based on the `order_date` to only include those from December 2020.  4. **Formulate the Filtering Criteria**:    - The `order_date` column in the `cust_order` table is in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`. To filter for December 2020, we need dates that start with '2020-12'.  5. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Use a `SELECT` statement to count the number of orders. The `LIKE` operator can be used to match the date pattern for December 2020.    - The SQL query becomes: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM cust_order WHERE order_date LIKE '2020-12%'`.  6. **Verify the Solution**:    - Ensure that the query correctly counts all orders placed in December 2020 by checking the format and logic of the `LIKE` clause.    - Consider any edge cases, such as time zones or incorrect data entries, but these are typically handled by the database's date storage format.  By following these steps, we logically deduce the correct SQL query to solve the problem of counting the number of books ordered in the last month of 2020.",,

From the provided schema, the `customer` table is relevant.    - The `customer` table contains the columns `first_name` and `last_name`, which are necessary to construct the full name of the customers.  3. **Identify the Required Columns**:    - We need to select the `first_name` and `last_name` columns from the `customer` table to construct the full name of each customer.  4. **Formulate the Condition**:    - The condition for selecting customers is that their `last_name` should start with the letter 'K'.    - In SQL, this can be achieved using the `LIKE` operator with a pattern. The pattern 'K%' will match any last name that begins with 'K'.  5. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Use the `SELECT` statement to specify the columns to retrieve (`first_name` and `last_name`).    - Use the `FROM` clause to specify the `customer` table.    - Use the `WHERE` clause to apply the condition that the `last_name` must start with 'K'.  6. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Combine the above elements to form the SQL query:            SELECT first_name, last_name FROM customer WHERE last_name LIKE 'K%'        7. **Verify the Query**:    - Ensure that the query correctly retrieves the desired information by checking the syntax and logic.    - Consider edge cases, such as ensuring that the query is case-sensitive or case-insensitive as required by the database settings.

Here's how you can approach it:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: We need to find out in which cities the customers from Costa Rica are located. This means we need to identify addresses in Costa Rica and extract the city names from those addresses.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - We need information about addresses, specifically the city and country.    - The `address` table contains the `city` and `country_id` columns.    - The `country` table contains the `country_id` and `country_name` columns.  3. **Determine the Relationship Between Tables**:    - The `address` table has a `country_id` that can be used to link to the `country` table to get the `country_name`.    - We need to join these two tables to filter addresses based on the country name.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Start by selecting the `city` from the `address` table.    - Use an `INNER JOIN` to connect the `address` table with the `country` table on the `country_id`.    - Add a `WHERE` clause to filter the results to only include addresses where the `country_name` is 'Costa Rica'.  5. **Write the SQL Query**:    - The SQL query is constructed as follows:            SELECT T1.city      FROM address AS T1      INNER JOIN country AS T2 ON T2.country_id = T1.country_id      WHERE T2.country_name = 'Costa Rica';          - Here, `T1` is an alias for the `address` table, and `T2` is an alias for the `country` table. This makes the query more readable and concise.  6. **Verify the Solution**:    - Ensure that the query correctly joins the tables and filters the data to only include cities in Costa Rica.    - Check that the query returns the expected results by testing it with sample data or in a database environment.  By following these steps, you logically arrive at the solution to the problem, ensuring that all necessary tables and relationships are considered and that the query is structured correctly to meet the requirements.",,

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: We need to find the order dates for customers who live at street number 460. This implies that we need to connect customer orders with their addresses.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**: From the schema provided, the relevant tables are:    - `cust_order`: Contains information about customer orders, including `order_date` and `dest_address_id`.    - `address`: Contains address details, including `street_number`, which we need to filter by the value 460.  3. **Determine the Relationship Between Tables**:     - The `cust_order` table has a column `dest_address_id` that references the `address_id` in the `address` table. This relationship allows us to join these tables to get the address details for each order.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - **Select Clause**: We need the `order_date` from the `cust_order` table, so we start with `SELECT T1.order_date`.    - **From Clause**: We choose `cust_order` as the primary table since it contains the `order_date` we need.    - **Join Clause**: Use an `INNER JOIN` to connect `cust_order` with `address` on the condition that `cust_order.dest_address_id = address.address_id`. This allows us to access address details for each order.    - **Where Clause**: Filter the results to only include addresses with `street_number = 460`, as specified in the problem statement.  5. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Combine the above elements to form the complete SQL query:            SELECT T1.order_date      FROM cust_order AS T1      INNER JOIN address AS T2 ON T1.dest_address_id = T2.address_id      WHERE T2.street_number = 460;        6. **Verify the Query**: Ensure that the query accurately reflects the problem requirements and that it logically retrieves the correct data by checking the relationships and conditions used.  By following these steps, we can systematically arrive at the solution to the problem, ensuring that all necessary conditions are met and that the query is correctly structured to retrieve the desired information.",,

This will allow us to match each order's status with its description.    - Filter the results to only include rows where `status_value` is ""Cancelled"". This will give us the `order_id` of orders that have been cancelled.  6. **Write the SQL Query**:    - The SQL query is constructed as follows:            SELECT T2.order_id       FROM order_status AS T1       INNER JOIN order_history AS T2       ON T1.status_id = T2.status_id       WHERE T1.status_value = 'Cancelled';          - This query selects the `order_id` from the `order_history` table (`T2`) where the `status_value` in the `order_status` table (`T1`) is ""Cancelled"".  7. **Verify the Solution**:    - Ensure that the query correctly identifies all cancelled orders by checking the logic and the relationships used in the join.    - Consider edge cases, such as orders with multiple status changes, to ensure the query still returns the correct results.  By following these logical steps, you can systematically approach the problem and construct an effective SQL query to retrieve the desired information.",,

The `order_date` column in the `cust_order` table will be used to filter orders by this date.  4. **Plan the Query:**    - We need to join these tables to get the status of orders placed on the specified date.    - Start by joining `order_history` with `cust_order` using the `order_id` to filter orders by the specified date.    - Then, join the result with `order_status` using `status_id` to get the human-readable status.  5. **Write the SQL Query:**    - Use an INNER JOIN to connect the tables based on their relationships.    - Use a WHERE clause to filter orders by the specified date.    - Use SELECT DISTINCT to ensure each status is listed only once.  6. **Construct the SQL Query:**    - The SQL query is constructed as follows:   SELECT DISTINCT T1.status_value FROM order_status AS T1 INNER JOIN order_history AS T2 ON T1.status_id = T2.status_id INNER JOIN cust_order AS T3 ON T3.order_id = T2.order_id WHERE T3.order_date LIKE '2022-04-10%'   7. **Verify the Query:**    - Ensure the query logic aligns with the problem statement and schema.    - Check that the query correctly identifies the statuses of orders placed on 04/10/2022.  By following these steps, we can systematically approach and solve the problem using SQL.",,

This implies we need to look into the order details and prices.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**: Based on the schema, the relevant tables for this query are:    - `cust_order`: Contains order details including the `order_date`.    - `order_line`: Contains details of each line item in an order, including the `price` and `order_id`.  3. **Determine the Relationship Between Tables**:     - The `order_line` table has a foreign key `order_id` that references the `order_id` in the `cust_order` table. This relationship allows us to join these tables to get the order date for specific line items.  4. **Formulate the Join Condition**:     - To retrieve the order dates for specific prices, we need to join `cust_order` and `order_line` on the `order_id` field. This will allow us to access both the `order_date` and the `price` for each order.  5. **Filter the Results**:     - After joining the tables, we need to filter the results to only include those rows where the `price` is 16.54. This is done using a `WHERE` clause.  6. **Select the Required Columns**:     - Since the problem asks for the dates, we only need to select the `order_date` from the `cust_order` table.  7. **Write the SQL Query**:     - Combine all the above steps into a single SQL query:            SELECT T1.order_date      FROM cust_order AS T1      INNER JOIN order_line AS T2 ON T1.order_id = T2.order_id      WHERE T2.price = 16.54        8. **Verify the Solution**:     - Ensure that the query correctly retrieves the order dates where the price matches 16.54 by considering sample data and checking the logic against the schema.

Smith',"To solve the problem of listing the titles of all the books that Peter H. Smith wrote, we need to follow a series of logical steps to construct the SQL query. Here’s how we can approach it:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: We need to find all book titles written by a specific author, Peter H. Smith. This means we need to identify the relationship between books and authors in the database schema.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**: From the schema provided, the relevant tables are:    - `book`: Contains information about books, including `book_id` and `title`.    - `author`: Contains information about authors, including `author_id` and `author_name`.    - `book_author`: Acts as a junction table linking `book_id` and `author_id`, indicating which authors wrote which books.  3. **Determine the Relationships**:    - The `book_author` table connects books to authors through `book_id` and `author_id`.    - We need to join these tables to filter books by the specific author.  4. **Formulate the Query**:    - Start by selecting the `title` from the `book` table since we need the book titles.    - Use an `INNER JOIN` to connect the `book` table with the `book_author` table on `book_id`.    - Further, join the `book_author` table with the `author` table on `author_id` to access author details.    - Add a `WHERE` clause to filter the results to only include books written by ""Peter H. Smith"".  5. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - The SQL query should look like this:            SELECT T1.title      FROM book AS T1      INNER JOIN book_author AS T2 ON T1.book_id = T2.book_id      INNER JOIN author AS T3 ON T3.author_id = T2.author_id      WHERE T3.author_name = 'Peter H. Smith';        6. **Verify the Query**:    - Ensure that the query correctly joins the tables and filters the results based on the author's name.    - Check that the query selects only the `title` column from the `book` table, as required.  By following these steps, we logically deduce how to construct the SQL query to solve the problem of listing all book titles written by Peter H. Smith.",,

This requires identifying books with a specific language attribute.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**: From the schema provided, we need to identify which tables contain information about books and their languages. The relevant tables are:    - `book`: Contains details about each book, including `book_id` and `language_id`.    - `book_language`: Contains details about each language, including `language_id` and `language_name`.  3. **Determine the Relationship**: Understand the relationship between the `book` and `book_language` tables. The `book` table has a `language_id` column that corresponds to the `language_id` in the `book_language` table. This relationship allows us to join these tables to get the language details for each book.  4. **Formulate the Query**:    - **Join the Tables**: Use an INNER JOIN to combine the `book` and `book_language` tables based on the `language_id`. This will allow us to associate each book with its language details.    - **Filter by Language**: Add a WHERE clause to filter the results to only include books where the `language_name` is 'Japanese'.    - **Count the Results**: Use the COUNT(*) function to count the number of rows that satisfy the condition, which will give us the number of books published in Japanese.  5. **Write the SQL Query**: Based on the above logic, the SQL query would be:        SELECT COUNT(*)    FROM book_language AS T1    INNER JOIN book AS T2 ON T1.language_id = T2.language_id    WHERE T1.language_name = 'Japanese';      6. **Verify the Solution**: Ensure that the query accurately reflects the problem statement and that the logic aligns with the schema provided. Check for any potential errors or assumptions, such as ensuring 'Japanese' is correctly spelled and exists in the `language_name` column.  By following these steps, we can systematically approach the problem and construct a query that accurately counts the number of books published in Japanese.",,

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process:  1. **Identify the Relevant Tables:**    - We need to find books written by a specific author, Jennifer Crusie. The relevant tables for this task are:      - `author`: Contains author information, including `author_name`.      - `book`: Contains book information, including `num_pages`.      - `book_author`: Acts as a junction table linking books to authors through `book_id` and `author_id`.  2. **Determine the Necessary Columns:**    - We need the `author_name` from the `author` table to filter for Jennifer Crusie.    - We need the `num_pages` from the `book` table to calculate the average number of pages.    - We need the `book_id` and `author_id` from the `book_author` table to join the `book` and `author` tables.  3. **Plan the Joins:**    - To link the `book` and `author` tables, we use the `book_author` table:      - Join `book` with `book_author` on `book.book_id = book_author.book_id`.      - Join `book_author` with `author` on `book_author.author_id = author.author_id`.  4. **Filter the Data:**    - Use a `WHERE` clause to filter the results to only include books written by Jennifer Crusie. This involves checking `author_name` in the `author` table.  5. **Calculate the Average:**    - Use the `AVG()` function to calculate the average number of pages (`num_pages`) for the filtered books.  6. **Construct the SQL Query:**    - Combine all the above steps into a coherent SQL query:            SELECT AVG(T1.num_pages)      FROM book AS T1      INNER JOIN book_author AS T2 ON T1.book_id = T2.book_id      INNER JOIN author AS T3 ON T3.author_id = T2.author_id      WHERE T3.author_name = 'Jennifer Crusie';        7. **Verify the Query:**    - Ensure the query correctly joins the tables and filters the data as intended.    - Check that the query calculates the average number of pages for books authored by Jennifer Crusie.  By following these logical steps, we can construct a query that accurately answers the problem statement.",,

Here's how we can approach the problem:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement:**    - We need to calculate the percentage of orders placed by a customer named Kaleena that were shipped using the ""International"" shipping method.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables:**    - From the schema, identify the tables that contain relevant information:      - `customer`: To find the customer named Kaleena.      - `cust_order`: To find orders placed by Kaleena.      - `shipping_method`: To identify the shipping method used for each order.  3. **Determine the Necessary Joins:**    - To link the information from the relevant tables, determine the necessary joins:      - Join `customer` and `cust_order` on `customer_id` to get orders placed by Kaleena.      - Join `cust_order` and `shipping_method` on `shipping_method_id` to get the shipping method used for each order.  4. **Filter for the Specific Customer:**    - Use a `WHERE` clause to filter the results to only include orders placed by Kaleena. This can be done by filtering on `first_name = 'Kaleena'` in the `customer` table.  5. **Calculate the Percentage:**    - Use a `CASE` statement within the `SUM` function to count the number of orders shipped using the ""International"" method.    - Divide this count by the total number of orders placed by Kaleena to get the percentage.    - Multiply by 100 to convert the result into a percentage.  6. **Construct the SQL Query:**    - Combine the above steps into a single SQL query:            SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN T3.method_name = 'International' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(*)      FROM customer AS T1      INNER JOIN cust_order AS T2 ON T1.customer_id = T2.customer_id      INNER JOIN shipping_method AS T3 ON T3.method_id = T2.shipping_method_id      WHERE T1.first_name = 'Kaleena'        7. **Verify and Test the Query:**    - Ensure the query logic is correct by testing it with sample data or in a test environment to verify that it returns the expected results.  By following these steps, we can logically derive the solution to the problem and construct an SQL query that calculates the desired percentage.",,

Here are the steps:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: We need to find all books ordered by a specific customer, Ursola Purdy. This involves identifying the relationship between customers and books through orders.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**: From the schema, identify the tables that are relevant to customers, orders, and books:    - `customer`: Contains customer information including names.    - `cust_order`: Represents orders placed by customers.    - `order_line`: Details the books included in each order.    - `book`: Contains information about each book, including titles.  3. **Determine Table Relationships**: Understand how these tables are connected:    - The `customer` table is linked to the `cust_order` table via `customer_id`.    - The `cust_order` table is linked to the `order_line` table via `order_id`.    - The `order_line` table is linked to the `book` table via `book_id`.  4. **Plan the SQL Query**:    - Start from the `book` table since we need to list book titles.    - Join the `order_line` table to access the `book_id` that connects books to orders.    - Join the `cust_order` table to access `order_id` and link orders to customers.    - Join the `customer` table to filter orders by the specific customer, Ursola Purdy.  5. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Use `INNER JOIN` to connect these tables based on the relationships identified.    - Filter the results using `WHERE` clause to match the customer's first and last name.  6. **Write the SQL Query**:        SELECT T1.title    FROM book AS T1    INNER JOIN order_line AS T2 ON T1.book_id = T2.book_id    INNER JOIN cust_order AS T3 ON T3.order_id = T2.order_id    INNER JOIN customer AS T4 ON T4.customer_id = T3.customer_id    WHERE T4.first_name = 'Ursola' AND T4.last_name = 'Purdy';      7. **Verify the Query**: Ensure that the query correctly joins the tables and filters the results to only include books ordered by Ursola Purdy.  By following these logical steps, we can systematically derive the SQL query needed to solve the problem.",,

Since we need a count, we'll use `COUNT(*)`.    - Perform an `INNER JOIN` between `author` and `book_author` on `author_id`.    - Use a `WHERE` clause to filter records where `author_name` is 'Akira Watanabe'.  5. **Write the SQL Query**:    - The SQL query should look like this:            SELECT COUNT(*)      FROM author AS T1      INNER JOIN book_author AS T2 ON T1.author_id = T2.author_id      WHERE T1.author_name = 'Akira Watanabe';        6. **Verify the Query**:    - Ensure that the query correctly counts the number of books by checking the relationships and constraints in the schema.    - Validate the query logic by considering edge cases, such as multiple authors with similar names or books with multiple authors.  By following these steps, we can logically derive the solution to the problem and write an effective SQL query to find the number of books written by Akira Watanabe available on Gravity.",,

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process:  1. **Identify the Target Information**: We need to find the full address of a customer named Ursola Purdy. This includes the street number, street name, city, and potentially the country.  2. **Locate the Customer**:     - Start by identifying the table that contains customer information. The `customer` table has columns `first_name` and `last_name`, which can be used to locate Ursola Purdy.  3. **Link Customer to Address**:    - The `customer` table does not directly contain address information. We need to find a way to link customers to their addresses.    - The `customer_address` table provides a link between `customer_id` and `address_id`. This table will help us associate Ursola Purdy with her address.  4. **Retrieve Address Details**:    - Once we have the `address_id` from the `customer_address` table, we can use it to retrieve detailed address information from the `address` table.    - The `address` table contains columns like `street_number`, `street_name`, and `city`, which are part of the full address we need.  5. **Consider Country Information**:    - Although the problem does not explicitly ask for the country, it might be useful to include it if needed. The `address` table has a `country_id` that can be linked to the `country` table to get the `country_name`.  6. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Start by joining the `customer` table with the `customer_address` table on `customer_id` to filter for Ursola Purdy.    - Then, join the result with the `address` table on `address_id` to get the street number, street name, and city.    - Optionally, join with the `country` table on `country_id` if country information is required.  7. **Write the SQL Query**:    - The SQL query is constructed using INNER JOINs to connect these tables and a WHERE clause to filter for the specific customer, Ursola Purdy.  Here's the SQL query based on the above reasoning:   SELECT T3.street_number, T3.street_name, T3.city FROM customer AS T1 INNER JOIN customer_address AS T2 ON T1.customer_id = T2.customer_id INNER JOIN address AS T3 ON T3.address_id = T2.address_id INNER JOIN country AS T4 ON T4.country_id = T3.country_id WHERE T1.first_name = 'Ursola' AND T1.last_name = 'Purdy';   This query retrieves the street number, street name, and city for Ursola Purdy by joining the relevant tables and applying the necessary filters.",,

Here is a breakdown of the reasoning process:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: We need to find the publisher of a specific book titled ""Girls' Night In."" This requires us to look into the database tables to find the relevant information.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**: From the schema, we recognize that the information about books and publishers is likely stored in the `book` and `publisher` tables. The `book` table contains details about each book, including its title and publisher ID, while the `publisher` table contains the names of publishers.  3. **Determine the Relationship Between Tables**: The `book` table has a `publisher_id` column that links to the `publisher_id` column in the `publisher` table. This relationship allows us to join these tables to get the publisher's name for a given book.  4. **Formulate the Query**:    - **Select the Necessary Columns**: We need to select the `publisher_name` from the `publisher` table.    - **Join the Tables**: Use an INNER JOIN to connect the `book` table with the `publisher` table on the `publisher_id` column. This will allow us to access the publisher's name for each book.    - **Filter by Book Title**: Add a WHERE clause to filter the results to only include the book titled ""Girls' Night In.""  5. **Construct the SQL Query**: Based on the above steps, the SQL query is constructed as follows:        SELECT T2.publisher_name    FROM book AS T1    INNER JOIN publisher AS T2 ON T1.publisher_id = T2.publisher_id    WHERE T1.title = 'Girls'' Night In'      6. **Verify the Solution**: Ensure that the query correctly identifies the publisher by checking that the join and filter conditions are correctly applied.  By following these logical steps, we can confidently construct the SQL query to find the publisher of the book ""Girls' Night In.""",,

This implies that we need to focus on the `shipping_method` table, which contains information about different shipping methods and their associated costs.  2. **Identify Relevant Table and Columns**: From the schema provided, the `shipping_method` table is relevant because it contains the `method_name` and `cost` columns. These columns will help us filter the specific shipping methods (Priority and Express) and calculate their costs.  3. **Formulate the Query**:    - We need to calculate the total cost for each of the two shipping methods separately.    - Use the `SUM` function to aggregate the costs for each shipping method.    - Use a `CASE` statement to conditionally sum the costs based on the `method_name`.  4. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Use a `SELECT` statement to calculate the total cost for Priority and Express shipping methods.    - Use `SUM(CASE WHEN method_name = 'Priority' THEN cost ELSE 0 END)` to calculate the total cost for Priority shipping.    - Use `SUM(CASE WHEN method_name = 'Express' THEN cost ELSE 0 END)` to calculate the total cost for Express shipping.    - Subtract the total cost of Express from the total cost of Priority to get the cost difference.  5. **Consider Edge Cases**:    - Ensure that there are no null values in the `cost` column that could affect the calculation.    - Check if both shipping methods exist in the table to avoid incorrect results.  6. **Execute and Verify the Query**:    - Run the query against the database to ensure it returns the expected result.    - Verify the result by manually checking a few entries if possible.  By following these steps, we can logically derive the solution to calculate the cost difference between Priority and Express shipping methods using the given schema. The final SQL query is:   SELECT      SUM(CASE WHEN method_name = 'Priority' THEN cost ELSE 0 END) -      SUM(CASE WHEN method_name = 'Express' THEN cost ELSE 0 END)  FROM      shipping_method;",,

This requires identifying the relevant table and column that store publication information.  2. **Identify Relevant Table and Column**:     - Review the provided schema to locate the table that contains information about books. The `book` table is the most relevant as it contains details about each book.    - Within the `book` table, identify the column that stores the publication date. The column `publication_date` holds this information.  3. **Extract Year from Publication Date**:    - Since the publication date is stored in a date format, we need to extract the year component to filter books published in 2017.    - Use a date function to extract the year from the `publication_date`. In SQL, the `STRFTIME` function can be used to format date components. The expression `STRFTIME('%Y', publication_date)` extracts the year from the `publication_date`.  4. **Filter Books Published in 2017**:    - Apply a filter to select only those records where the extracted year is 2017. This can be done using a `WHERE` clause in the SQL query.  5. **Count the Number of Books**:    - Use the `COUNT` function to count the number of rows that meet the criteria of being published in 2017. This will give the total number of books published in that year.  6. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Combine the above steps into a complete SQL query. The query should select from the `book` table, filter by the year 2017, and count the resulting records.  The final SQL query is:  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM book WHERE STRFTIME('%Y', publication_date) = '2017'   This query effectively counts all books in the `book` table where the publication year is 2017, providing the desired result.",,

The ISBN is a unique identifier for books, and we need to locate it in the database.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**: From the provided schema, identify which table contains information about books. The `book` table is the most relevant as it contains columns such as `title` and `isbn13`.  3. **Examine the `book` Table Structure**: Look at the columns in the `book` table:    - `book_id`: A unique identifier for each book.    - `title`: The title of the book.    - `isbn13`: The ISBN of the book.    - Other columns such as `language_id`, `num_pages`, `publication_date`, and `publisher_id` are not directly relevant to finding the ISBN for a specific title.  4. **Formulate the Query**: Since the task is to find the ISBN for a book with a specific title, we can use a simple `SELECT` query to retrieve the `isbn13` where the `title` matches ""The Mystery in the Rocky Mountains.""  5. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Use the `SELECT` statement to specify that we want to retrieve the `isbn13`.    - Use the `FROM` clause to specify the `book` table as the source of data.    - Use the `WHERE` clause to filter the results to only include the row where the `title` is ""The Mystery in the Rocky Mountains.""  6. **Execute the Query**: The final SQL query is:        SELECT isbn13 FROM book WHERE title = 'The Mystery in the Rocky Mountains';        This query will return the ISBN of the book with the specified title.  By following these steps, we logically deduce that the solution involves querying the `book` table to find the ISBN for the given book title.",,

This involves identifying orders with a 'Returned' status and comparing them to the total number of orders updated in 2022.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - We need information about order statuses and their update dates. The `order_status` table contains status descriptions, and the `order_history` table contains the status update history for each order.    - The `order_history` table has `status_id` and `status_date`, which are crucial for filtering orders updated in 2022.    - The `order_status` table has `status_id` and `status_value`, which will help us identify the 'Returned' status.  3. **Filter Orders Updated in 2022**:    - Use the `order_history` table to filter records where the `status_date` falls within the year 2022.

Here's how we can approach the problem:  1. **Understand the Schema and Relationships**:    - We have two relevant tables: `customer_address` and `address_status`.    - The `customer_address` table contains the `status_id` for each address, which indicates whether the address is active or inactive.    - The `address_status` table maps `status_id` to `address_status`, which can be either 'Active' or 'Inactive'.  2. **Identify the Relevant Data**:    - We need to determine which addresses are 'Inactive'. This requires checking the `address_status` column in the `address_status` table.    - We also need to count the total number of addresses to calculate the percentage.  3. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - We will perform an `INNER JOIN` between `customer_address` and `address_status` on the `status_id` to get the status of each address.    - Use a `CASE` statement to count addresses that are 'Inactive'. This will help us determine the number of inactive addresses.  4. **Calculate the Percentage**:    - Use the `SUM` function with the `CASE` statement to count the number of inactive addresses.    - Use the `COUNT(*)` function to get the total number of addresses.    - Calculate the percentage by dividing the number of inactive addresses by the total number of addresses, and multiply by 100 to get the percentage.  5. **Ensure Correct Data Types**:    - Cast the result of the division to a `REAL` type to ensure that the division results in a decimal value, allowing for a precise percentage calculation.  6. **Write the Final SQL Query**:    - Combine all the above steps into a single SQL query.  Here is the final SQL query based on the above reasoning:   SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN T2.address_status = 'Inactive' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(*)  FROM customer_address AS T1  INNER JOIN address_status AS T2 ON T2.status_id = T1.status_id;   This query calculates the percentage of addresses that are inactive by joining the necessary tables, counting inactive addresses, and computing the percentage relative to the total number of addresses.",,

We need to find the relevant information from the database schema provided.  2. **Identify Relevant Table**: From the schema, we need to determine which table contains information about books. The table named `book` is the most relevant as it contains columns related to books, including `title` and `num_pages`.  3. **Locate Necessary Columns**: Within the `book` table, identify the columns that are pertinent to the problem:    - `title`: This column will allow us to filter the book records to find the one titled 'Seaward'.    - `num_pages`: This column contains the number of pages for each book, which is the information we need to retrieve.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**: Construct a SQL query that selects the `num_pages` from the `book` table where the `title` matches 'Seaward'. This can be done using a simple `SELECT` statement with a `WHERE` clause to filter by the book title.  5. **Write the SQL Query**: Based on the above understanding, the SQL query would be:        SELECT num_pages FROM book WHERE title = 'Seaward';      6. **Verify the Query**: Ensure that the query is correctly structured to return the number of pages for the book titled 'Seaward'. The query should return a single value corresponding to the number of pages if the book exists in the database.  By following these steps, we logically deduce the necessary actions to retrieve the required information from the database.",,

Here's how we can approach this:  1. **Understand the Problem:**    - We need to find all books written by the author ""Tom Clancy"".    - The output should be a list of book titles.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables:**    - From the schema, the relevant tables are:      - `author`: Contains information about authors, including `author_id` and `author_name`.      - `book`: Contains information about books, including `book_id` and `title`.      - `book_author`: Acts as a junction table linking books and authors, containing `book_id` and `author_id`.  3. **Determine the Relationships:**    - The `book_author` table links the `book` table and the `author` table through `book_id` and `author_id`, respectively.    - We need to join these tables to get the desired information.  4. **Plan the Joins:**    - Start with the `book` table to get the book titles.    - Join `book_author` on `book_id` to link each book to its authors.    - Join `author` on `author_id` to filter by the specific author name, ""Tom Clancy"".  5. **Filter the Results:**    - Use a `WHERE` clause to filter the results to only include books where the `author_name` is ""Tom Clancy"".  6. **Select the Desired Columns:**    - Select the `title` column from the `book` table as the final output.  7. **Construct the SQL Query:**    - Using the above plan, construct the SQL query as follows:   SELECT T1.title  FROM book AS T1  INNER JOIN book_author AS T2 ON T1.book_id = T2.book_id  INNER JOIN author AS T3 ON T3.author_id = T2.author_id  WHERE T3.author_name = 'Tom Clancy';   8. **Review and Validate:**    - Ensure the query correctly joins the tables and filters the results based on the author name.    - Validate the query logic against the schema to ensure all joins and conditions are correctly applied.

Here's a logical breakdown of the steps to arrive at the solution:  1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to find a book by a specific author (Hirohiko Araki) that was published on a specific date (6/6/2006).  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**:     - The `book` table contains information about books, including their titles and publication dates.    - The `author` table contains information about authors, including their names.    - The `book_author` table serves as a junction table that links books to their authors.  3. **Determine Necessary Columns**:    - From the `book` table, we need the `title` and `publication_date`.    - From the `author` table, we need the `author_name`.    - From the `book_author` table, we need to link `book_id` and `author_id` to associate books with their authors.  4. **Plan the Query**:    - We need to join the `book`, `book_author`, and `author` tables to combine the necessary data.    - Use an INNER JOIN to connect these tables:      - Join `book` and `book_author` on `book_id` to get the books and their authors.      - Join `book_author` and `author` on `author_id` to get the author's name.  5. **Filter the Results**:    - Use a WHERE clause to filter for the specific author, Hirohiko Araki.    - Additionally, filter for the publication date of 6/6/2006.  6. **Select the Required Output**:    - Select the `title` of the book that meets the criteria.  7. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Based on the above steps, the SQL query is constructed as follows:            SELECT T1.title      FROM book AS T1      INNER JOIN book_author AS T2 ON T1.book_id = T2.book_id      INNER JOIN author AS T3 ON T3.author_id = T2.author_id      WHERE T3.author_name = 'Hirohiko Araki'      AND T1.publication_date = '2006-06-06'        By following these logical steps, we ensure that we accurately retrieve the desired information from the database.",,

The `book` table has a `publisher_id` column that links to the `publisher_id` column in the `publisher` table. This relationship allows us to join these tables.  4. **Formulate the Query**:    - Start by selecting the `publisher_name` from the `publisher` table, as this is the information we need.    - Use an `INNER JOIN` to connect the `book` table with the `publisher` table on the `publisher_id` column. This join will allow us to retrieve the publisher's name corresponding to the book's publisher ID.    - Add a `WHERE` clause to filter the `book` table for the specific title ""Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy: The Filming of the Douglas Adams classic.""  5. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - The SQL query should select the `publisher_name` from the `publisher` table, joining it with the `book` table where the `title` matches the given book title.  6. **Write the Final Query**:        SELECT T2.publisher_name    FROM book AS T1    INNER JOIN publisher AS T2 ON T1.publisher_id = T2.publisher_id    WHERE T1.title = 'Hitchhiker''s Guide To The Galaxy: The Filming of the Douglas Adams classic';      7. **Verify the Solution**: Ensure that the query correctly retrieves the publisher's name for the specified book title by checking the logical flow and the join condition.

The `book` table has a column `publisher_id` which is a foreign key referencing the `publisher_id` in the `publisher` table.  4. **Select Necessary Columns**:    - We need the titles of the books, which are found in the `title` column of the `book` table.  5. **Formulate the Join Condition**:    - To link the `book` table with the `publisher` table, use the `publisher_id` column. This will allow us to access the publisher's name for each book.  6. **Apply the Filter Condition**:    - We need to filter the results to only include books where the publisher's name is ""ADV Manga"". This requires a `WHERE` clause that checks the `publisher_name` column in the `publisher` table.  7. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Use an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `book` and `publisher` tables based on the `publisher_id`.    - Select the `title` from the `book` table where the `publisher_name` is ""ADV Manga"".  8. **Write the SQL Query**:    - The final SQL query is:            SELECT T1.title       FROM book AS T1       INNER JOIN publisher AS T2       ON T1.publisher_id = T2.publisher_id       WHERE T2.publisher_name = 'ADV Manga';        By following these steps, we logically deduce the correct SQL query to solve the problem of listing all books published by ""ADV Manga"".",,

To do this, we need to first find the corresponding `country_id` from the `address` table.  4. **Formulate the Query**:    - **Select the Country Name**: We want to select the `country_name` from the `country` table.    - **Join the Tables**: Use an INNER JOIN to connect the `address` table with the `country` table using the `country_id` column, which is common to both tables.    - **Apply the Conditions**: Filter the results from the `address` table where the `street_number` is 9, the `street_name` is 'Green Ridge Point', and the `city` is 'Arendal'. These conditions ensure we are looking at the correct address.  5. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Start by selecting the `country_name` from the `country` table.    - Perform an INNER JOIN between the `address` and `country` tables on the `country_id`.    - Add a WHERE clause to filter the address by `street_number`, `street_name`, and `city`.  6. **Review and Execute**: Ensure the query logic aligns with the problem requirements and execute it to get the desired result.  The final SQL query is:  SELECT T2.country_name  FROM address AS T1  INNER JOIN country AS T2 ON T2.country_id = T1.country_id  WHERE T1.street_number = 9  AND T1.street_name = 'Green Ridge Point'  AND T1.city = 'Arendal';   This query will return the name of the country where the address ""9 Green Ridge Point, Arendal"" is located.",,

This requires identifying the relevant tables and columns that can provide address details and country information.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**:    - **`address` Table**: This table contains address details such as street number, street name, city, and a `country_id` that links to the country information.    - **`country` Table**: This table contains country details, including `country_id` and `country_name`. This will help us identify which addresses are in Poland.  3. **Determine the Relationship**:    - The `address` table has a `country_id` column that can be used to join with the `country` table's `country_id` column. This relationship allows us to link addresses to their respective countries.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - **Select Required Columns**: From the `address` table, select the columns `street_number`, `street_name`, and `city` as these represent the address details we need.    - **Join Tables**: Use an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `address` table with the `country` table on the `country_id` column. This will filter addresses based on their country.    - **Filter for Poland**: Use a `WHERE` clause to filter the results where `country_name` is 'Poland'. This ensures we only get addresses located in Poland.    - **Limit the Results**: Use `LIMIT 10` to restrict the output to only 10 addresses, as specified in the problem statement.  5. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Combine all the above steps into a coherent SQL query:            SELECT T1.street_number, T1.street_name, T1.city      FROM address AS T1      INNER JOIN country AS T2 ON T2.country_id = T1.country_id      WHERE T2.country_name = 'Poland'      LIMIT 10;        6. **Review and Validate**:    - Ensure that the query correctly joins the tables and filters the data as required.    - Verify that the query will return up to 10 addresses located in Poland, as intended.

This can be done using the `customer_id`.    - Next, we need to join the `cust_order` table with the `shipping_method` table to get the shipping method name. This can be done using the `shipping_method_id`.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Start by selecting the `method_name` from the `shipping_method` table.    - Use an `INNER JOIN` to connect `cust_order` and `customer` on `customer_id`.    - Use another `INNER JOIN` to connect `cust_order` and `shipping_method` on `shipping_method_id`.    - Apply the `WHERE` clause to filter the results for the specific customer (`first_name = 'Nicolette'` and `last_name = 'Sadler'`) and the specific order date and time (`order_date = '2020-06-29 19:40:07'`).  5. **Write the SQL Query**:    - The SQL query should look like this:            SELECT T3.method_name      FROM cust_order AS T1      INNER JOIN customer AS T2 ON T1.customer_id = T2.customer_id      INNER JOIN shipping_method AS T3 ON T3.method_id = T1.shipping_method_id      WHERE T2.first_name = 'Nicolette'      AND T2.last_name = 'Sadler'      AND T1.order_date = '2020-06-29 19:40:07'        6. **Verify the Query**:    - Ensure that the query correctly joins the necessary tables and filters the data based on the problem requirements.    - Check that the query will return the correct shipping method name for the specified order.

Here's how we can approach this:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: We need to list all books that are written in the Arabic language. This requires identifying the relevant tables and columns that store information about books and their languages.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**: From the schema provided, we need to determine which tables contain information about books and languages. The `book` table contains information about books, and the `book_language` table contains information about languages.  3. **Determine the Relationship Between Tables**: We need to find out how these tables are related. By examining the schema, we see that the `book` table has a `language_id` column, which likely corresponds to the `language_id` column in the `book_language` table. This suggests a relationship between these two tables based on the `language_id`.  4. **Identify Necessary Columns**: To list books in Arabic, we need the `title` column from the `book` table and the `language_name` column from the `book_language` table to filter for Arabic.  5. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Use an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `book` and `book_language` tables based on the `language_id` column, which is common to both tables.    - Select the `title` column from the `book` table.    - Use a `WHERE` clause to filter the results where `language_name` is 'Arabic'.  6. **Write the SQL Query**: Based on the above steps, the SQL query would be:        SELECT T1.title    FROM book AS T1    INNER JOIN book_language AS T2 ON T1.language_id = T2.language_id    WHERE T2.language_name = 'Arabic';      7. **Verify the Solution**: Ensure that the query correctly joins the tables and filters for books written in Arabic. Check the schema to confirm that all column names and table names are correct.  By following these steps, we logically deduce the solution to list all books written in Arabic using the given database schema.",,

Here's how we can approach the problem:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: We need to find out the language of the book titled ""El plan infinito"". This requires us to identify the relevant tables and columns in the schema that can provide this information.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**:     - The `book` table contains information about books, including their titles and the language they are written in (via `language_id`).    - The `book_language` table provides details about languages, including language names and their corresponding `language_id`.  3. **Determine the Relationship Between Tables**:     - The `book` table has a `language_id` column that can be linked to the `language_id` column in the `book_language` table. This relationship allows us to find the language name corresponding to a particular book.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Start by selecting the `language_name` from the `book_language` table, as this is the information we need to retrieve.    - Use an INNER JOIN to connect the `book` table with the `book_language` table based on the `language_id`.    - Add a WHERE clause to filter the results to only include the book with the title ""El plan infinito"".  5. **Write the SQL Query**:    - The SQL query is formulated as follows:            SELECT T2.language_name      FROM book AS T1      INNER JOIN book_language AS T2 ON T1.language_id = T2.language_id      WHERE T1.title = 'El plan infinito'          - This query selects the `language_name` from the `book_language` table (`T2`) where the `language_id` matches the `language_id` in the `book` table (`T1`) for the book titled ""El plan infinito"".  6. **Verify the Solution**:    - Ensure that the query correctly retrieves the language name by checking the schema and understanding the relationships between tables.    - Confirm that the query logic aligns with the problem requirements and that all necessary conditions are included.  By following these logical steps, we can confidently determine the language in which ""El plan infinito"" is written using the provided database schema.",,

This involves checking the `author_name` column in the `author` table.  5. **Calculate the Average**:    - Once we have the list of books and their page numbers for Zilpha Keatley Snyder, use the `AVG()` function to calculate the average number of pages.  6. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Construct the SQL query using `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables and `AVG()` to compute the average. The query should look like this:   SELECT AVG(T3.num_pages) FROM book_author AS T1 INNER JOIN author AS T2 ON T1.author_id = T2.author_id INNER JOIN book AS T3 ON T3.book_id = T1.book_id WHERE T2.author_name = 'Zilpha Keatley Snyder';   7. **Verify the Solution**:    - Ensure the query logically retrieves the correct data by checking the joins and the filter condition.    - Test the query on the database to verify it returns the expected result.  By following these steps, we can systematically solve the problem and arrive at the correct SQL query to find the average number of pages for books written by Zilpha Keatley Snyder.",,

This requires us to identify the relevant table and columns that contain information about books and their page counts.  2. **Identify the Relevant Table**: From the provided schema, locate the table that contains book-related information. The `book` table is the most relevant as it includes details about each book, such as `title` and `num_pages`.  3. **Identify the Required Columns**: Within the `book` table, identify the columns that are necessary to solve the problem. We need:    - `title`: To know the name of the book.    - `num_pages`: To determine the number of pages each book has.  4. **Formulate the Query**:    - **Select the Title**: We need to retrieve the `title` of the book.    - **Order by Number of Pages**: To find the book with the most pages, sort the books by `num_pages` in descending order. This ensures that the book with the highest number of pages appears first.    - **Limit the Results**: Use a `LIMIT` clause to restrict the result to only the top entry, which will be the book with the most pages.  5. **Write the SQL Query**: Combine the above steps into a structured SQL query:        SELECT title FROM book ORDER BY num_pages DESC LIMIT 1;        - This query selects the `title` from the `book` table, orders the results by `num_pages` in descending order, and limits the output to the top result, effectively giving us the book with the most pages.  6. **Validate the Query**: Ensure the query is syntactically correct and logically aligns with the problem statement. Check if the schema supports the query structure and that the `book` table contains the necessary data.  By following these steps, we can systematically arrive at the solution to identify the book with the most number of pages.",,

Ayer',"To solve the problem of determining how many books were written by author A.J. Ayer, we need to follow a series of logical steps based on the provided schema. Here is a detailed breakdown of the thought process:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to find the number of books written by a specific author, A.J. Ayer.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**:    - From the schema, the tables that are relevant to this problem are `author`, `book`, and `book_author`.    - The `author` table contains information about authors, including their names.    - The `book` table contains information about books, but it does not directly relate books to authors.    - The `book_author` table serves as a junction table that links books to authors through `book_id` and `author_id`.  3. **Determine the Necessary Joins**:    - To find books written by A.J. Ayer, we need to join the `book_author` table with the `author` table to filter by the author's name.    - Specifically, we will join `book_author` on `author_id` with the `author` table to access the `author_name`.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Start by selecting from the `book_author` table because it contains the relationship between books and authors.    - Perform an INNER JOIN with the `author` table on the `author_id` column to filter authors by name.    - Use a WHERE clause to specify that we are interested in the author named 'A.J. Ayer'.  5. **Count the Results**:    - Since we need to know how many books were written by A.J. Ayer, use the COUNT function to count the number of rows that meet the criteria.  6. **Write the Final Query**:    - The final SQL query is:            SELECT COUNT(*)       FROM book_author AS T1       INNER JOIN author AS T2       ON T1.author_id = T2.author_id       WHERE T2.author_name = 'A.J. Ayer';        7. **Verify the Logic**:    - Ensure that the query correctly joins the tables and filters by the author's name.    - Confirm that the COUNT function is applied to the correct set of data, which is the result of the join and filter operations.  By following these logical steps, we can confidently determine the number of books written by A.J. Ayer using the given database schema.",,

Ayer',"To solve the SQL problem of finding the titles of books written by the author A.J. Ayer, we can follow these logical steps:  1. **Understand the Schema**:     - Familiarize yourself with the tables and their relationships. The relevant tables for this query are `author`, `book`, and `book_author`.    - The `author` table contains information about authors, including `author_id` and `author_name`.    - The `book` table contains information about books, including `book_id` and `title`.    - The `book_author` table acts as a junction table linking books to authors, containing `book_id` and `author_id`.  2. **Identify the Necessary Tables**:    - Since we need to find books by a specific author, we will need the `author` table to identify the author, the `book_author` table to find the relationship between authors and books, and the `book` table to get the book titles.  3. **Determine the Relationships**:    - The `author` table can be joined with the `book_author` table using the `author_id` column.    - The `book_author` table can be joined with the `book` table using the `book_id` column.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Start by selecting the `title` from the `book` table.    - Perform an `INNER JOIN` between the `book_author` and `author` tables on `author_id` to filter for the specific author, A.J. Ayer.    - Perform another `INNER JOIN` between the `book_author` and `book` tables on `book_id` to get the titles of the books.    - Add a `WHERE` clause to filter the results for the author named 'A.J. Ayer'.  5. **Write the SQL Query**:    - The final SQL query is:            SELECT T3.title      FROM book_author AS T1      INNER JOIN author AS T2 ON T1.author_id = T2.author_id      INNER JOIN book AS T3 ON T3.book_id = T1.book_id      WHERE T2.author_name = 'A.J. Ayer';        6. **Verify the Query**:    - Ensure the query logic aligns with the problem statement and schema.    - Check that the joins correctly link the tables and that the `WHERE` clause accurately filters for the desired author.  By following these steps, you can systematically approach the problem and construct a query that retrieves the desired information from the database.",,

This involves determining the proportion of English books relative to the total number of books published by this publisher.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - **book**: Contains information about each book, including `language_id` and `publisher_id`.    - **book_language**: Contains the mapping of `language_id` to `language_name`.    - **publisher**: Contains the mapping of `publisher_id` to `publisher_name`.  3. **Determine the Relationships**:    - The `book` table links to the `book_language` table through `language_id`.    - The `book` table links to the `publisher` table through `publisher_id`.  4. **Filter Books by Publisher**:    - We need to filter books where the `publisher_name` is ""Carole Marsh Mysteries."" This requires joining the `book` table with the `publisher` table on `publisher_id` and applying a filter condition.  5. **Identify English Books**:    - We need to identify books that are in English. This requires joining the `book` table with the `book_language` table on `language_id` and checking if `language_name` is ""English.""  6. **Calculate the Average**:    - Use a `CASE` statement to count only those books where `language_name` is ""English.""    - Calculate the total number of books published by ""Carole Marsh Mysteries.""    - Compute the average by dividing the count of English books by the total number of books.  7. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Use `INNER JOIN` to combine the `book`, `book_language`, and `publisher` tables.    - Use `WHERE` to filter books published by ""Carole Marsh Mysteries.""    - Use `SUM` and `COUNT` to calculate the proportion of English books.  8. **Ensure Correct Data Types**:    - Cast the sum of English books as `REAL` to ensure the division results in a floating-point number, which represents the average.  By following these steps, we arrive at the SQL solution:   SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN T1.language_name = 'English' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) / COUNT(*) FROM book_language AS T1 INNER JOIN book AS T2 ON T1.language_id = T2.language_id INNER JOIN publisher AS T3 ON T3.publisher_id = T2.publisher_id WHERE T3.publisher_name = 'Carole Marsh Mysteries';   This query calculates the average of English books among all books published by ""Carole Marsh Mysteries.""",,

Here are the logical steps to reach the solution:  1. **Understand the Schema and Problem Requirements**:     - We need to focus on the `book` and `publisher` tables because the problem involves filtering books based on the publisher and publication date.    - The `book` table contains information about the book's title, number of pages, publication date, and publisher ID.    - The `publisher` table contains information about the publisher's name and ID.  2. **Identify the Necessary Columns**:    - From the `book` table, we need the `title`, `num_pages`, `publication_date`, and `publisher_id`.    - From the `publisher` table, we need the `publisher_name` and `publisher_id`.  3. **Formulate the Join Condition**:    - To relate books to their publishers, we need to join the `book` and `publisher` tables on the `publisher_id` column, as this is the common key between the two tables.  4. **Filter by Publisher Name**:    - We need to filter the results to only include books published by ""Free Press"". This requires a condition on the `publisher_name` column in the `publisher` table.  5. **Filter by Publication Date**:    - The problem specifies a publication date range from 1990 to 2000. We need to extract the year from the `publication_date` column in the `book` table and filter it to be between 1990 and 2000.  6. **Sort by Number of Pages**:    - To find the book with the most pages, we need to sort the results in descending order based on the `num_pages` column.  7. **Select the Required Output**:    - We are only interested in the title of the book, so we select the `title` column from the `book` table.  8. **Limit the Result**:    - Since we only need the book with the most pages, we limit the result to 1.  9. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Combine all the above steps into a coherent SQL query:            SELECT T1.title       FROM book AS T1       INNER JOIN publisher AS T2 ON T1.publisher_id = T2.publisher_id       WHERE T2.publisher_name = 'Free Press'       AND STRFTIME('%Y', T1.publication_date) BETWEEN '1990' AND '2000'       ORDER BY T1.num_pages DESC       LIMIT 1;        By following these logical steps, we ensure that all conditions specified in the problem are met and the correct book title is retrieved.",,

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process:  1. **Identify the Relevant Tables:**    - We need to find the current address of a customer. The relevant tables for this task are:      - `customer`: Contains customer information, including names.      - `customer_address`: Links customers to their addresses and includes the status of the address.      - `address`: Contains details about the addresses.      - `address_status`: Provides the status of addresses (e.g., active or inactive).  2. **Determine the Necessary Columns:**    - From the `customer` table, we need the `first_name` to identify customer Kandy.    - From the `customer_address` table, we need `customer_id`, `address_id`, and `status_id` to link customers to their addresses and check the status.    - From the `address` table, we need `street_number`, `street_name`, and `city` to provide the address details.    - From the `address_status` table, we need `status_id` to ensure the address is active.  3. **Establish Table Relationships:**    - The `customer` table is linked to the `customer_address` table via `customer_id`.    - The `customer_address` table is linked to the `address` table via `address_id`.    - The `customer_address` table is linked to the `address_status` table via `status_id`.  4. **Filter for the Specific Customer:**    - We need to filter the `customer` table for the first name 'Kandy' to find the specific customer.  5. **Ensure the Address is Active:**    - We need to ensure that the address is currently active. This can be done by checking the `address_status` table for the status 'Active' (usually represented by a specific `status_id`).  6. **Construct the SQL Query:**    - Start with selecting the required address details (`street_number`, `street_name`, `city`) from the `address` table.    - Use INNER JOINs to connect the `customer`, `customer_address`, and `address` tables.    - Join the `address_status` table to filter for active addresses.    - Apply a WHERE clause to filter for the customer with the first name 'Kandy'.  7. **Write the SQL Query:**    - The final SQL query is:            SELECT T3.street_number, T3.street_name, T3.city      FROM customer AS T1      INNER JOIN customer_address AS T2 ON T1.customer_id = T2.customer_id      INNER JOIN address AS T3 ON T3.address_id = T2.address_id      INNER JOIN address_status AS T4 ON T4.status_id = T2.status_id      WHERE T1.first_name = 'Kandy'        By following these steps, we systematically identify the necessary tables and columns, establish relationships, apply filters, and construct a query to retrieve the desired information.",,

Here are the logical steps that could have been taken to reach the solution:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: We need to find out how many books were ordered by a specific customer, Kandy Adamec. This requires identifying the customer's orders and the books associated with those orders.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**: Based on the schema, the relevant tables for this problem are:    - `customer`: Contains customer details including first and last names.    - `cust_order`: Contains order details and links orders to customers via `customer_id`.    - `order_line`: Contains details of each line item in an order, including the `book_id`.  3. **Determine Relationships**:    - The `customer` table is related to the `cust_order` table through `customer_id`.    - The `cust_order` table is related to the `order_line` table through `order_id`.  4. **Formulate the Query**:    - Start by identifying the customer using their first and last name from the `customer` table.    - Join the `customer` table with the `cust_order` table on `customer_id` to get the orders placed by the customer.    - Join the resulting set with the `order_line` table on `order_id` to get the books associated with each order.  5. **Count the Books**:    - Use the `COUNT(*)` function to count the number of entries in the `order_line` table that match the criteria, as each entry corresponds to a book ordered.  6. **Write the SQL Query**:    - The SQL query is constructed by joining the tables and applying the necessary filters to count the books ordered by Kandy Adamec:            SELECT COUNT(*)      FROM order_line AS T1      INNER JOIN cust_order AS T2 ON T2.order_id = T1.order_id      INNER JOIN customer AS T3 ON T3.customer_id = T2.customer_id      WHERE T3.first_name = 'Kandy' AND T3.last_name = 'Adamec'        7. **Verify the Solution**:    - Ensure that the query correctly joins the tables and filters the data to count only the books ordered by the specified customer. Check the logic and relationships to confirm accuracy.  By following these steps, we systematically navigate the schema, understand the relationships between tables, and construct a query that accurately answers the problem statement.",,

This involves identifying the relevant tables and columns that can provide this information.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - We need to track order statuses, so the `order_status` table is relevant.

This will help us filter the statuses by date.  3. **Determine the Relationship Between Tables**:    - The `order_status` table and `order_history` table can be joined using the `status_id` column, as both tables contain this column.  4. **Filter for the ""Returned"" Status**:    - We need to filter the records where the `status_value` in the `order_status` table is ""Returned"".

We can use the `STRFTIME` function to extract the year from the date.  6. **Count the Number of Returned Orders**:    - After filtering the records for the ""Returned"" status and the year 2022, we need to count the number of such records. This can be done using the `COUNT(*)` function.  7. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Combine all the above steps into a SQL query that joins the `order_status` and `order_history` tables, filters for the ""Returned"" status and the year 2022, and counts the resulting records.

Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process:  1. **Identify the Relevant Tables**:     - Start by identifying which tables contain information about customers and their addresses. From the schema, we see that the `customer`, `customer_address`, `address`, and `country` tables are relevant.  2. **Locate the Customer**:    - The `customer` table contains customer details, including email addresses. We need to find the row where the email matches ""rturbitt2@geocities.jp"" to identify the specific customer.  3. **Find the Customer's Address**:    - Once we have the customer’s `customer_id` from the `customer` table, we need to find the corresponding address. The `customer_address` table links customers to addresses using `customer_id` and `address_id`.  4. **Retrieve Address Details**:    - With the `address_id` obtained from the `customer_address` table, we can look up the `address` table to find more details about the address, including the `country_id`.  5. **Determine the Country**:    - Finally, use the `country_id` from the `address` table to find the country name in the `country` table.  6. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Construct an SQL query that joins these tables to extract the country name for the customer with the specified email. The query should:      - Select the `country_name` from the `country` table.      - Join the `customer` table with the `customer_address` table on `customer_id`.      - Join the `customer_address` table with the `address` table on `address_id`.      - Join the `address` table with the `country` table on `country_id`.      - Filter the results to include only the row where the `email` is ""rturbitt2@geocities.jp"".  7. **Execute the Query**:    - Execute the formulated SQL query to retrieve the desired country name.  By following these logical steps, we ensure that we systematically navigate through the database schema to extract the required information accurately.",,

Ayer'`.    - **Order By Clause**: Order the results by `publication_date` in ascending order to find the earliest book.    - **Limit Clause**: Use `LIMIT 1` to get only the first book in the ordered list, which is the earliest one.  5. **Final SQL Query**:        SELECT T1.title     FROM book AS T1     INNER JOIN book_author AS T2 ON T1.book_id = T2.book_id     INNER JOIN author AS T3 ON T3.author_id = T2.author_id     WHERE T3.author_name = 'A.J.

Here’s how we can break down the process:  1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to calculate the percentage of books that cost more than $10 from the total number of books ordered by a specific customer, Ruthanne Vatini.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - **customer**: To identify the customer by name.    - **cust_order**: To find orders placed by the customer.    - **order_line**: To get details of each book in the orders, including the price.  3. **Establish Relationships**:    - The `customer` table is linked to the `cust_order` table through `customer_id`.    - The `cust_order` table is linked to the `order_line` table through `order_id`.  4. **Filter by Customer**:    - Use the `customer` table to filter records where `first_name` is 'Ruthanne' and `last_name` is 'Vatini'.  5. **Join Tables**:    - Join the `customer` table with the `cust_order` table to get all orders placed by Ruthanne Vatini.    - Further, join the result with the `order_line` table to get all books in those orders.  6. **Calculate the Required Percentage**:    - Use a `CASE` statement to count books where the `price` is greater than $10.    - Calculate the total number of books ordered by counting all entries in `order_line` for this customer.    - Compute the percentage by dividing the count of books costing more than $10 by the total count of books, and then multiply by 100.  7. **Write the SQL Query**:    - The SQL query should reflect the above logic:            SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN T1.price > 10 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(*)      FROM order_line AS T1      INNER JOIN cust_order AS T2 ON T2.order_id = T1.order_id      INNER JOIN customer AS T3 ON T3.customer_id = T2.customer_id      WHERE T3.first_name = 'Ruthanne' AND T3.last_name = 'Vatini'        8. **Verify the Solution**:    - Ensure the query correctly filters for the specific customer and accurately calculates the percentage of books costing more than $10.

The `book` table contains book titles and publisher IDs, while the `publisher` table contains publisher names and their corresponding IDs.  2. **Identify the Relationship Between Tables**:    - Recognize that the `book` table and the `publisher` table are related through the `publisher_id` column. This relationship allows us to join these tables to access both book titles and publisher names.  3. **Determine the Required Columns**:    - From the problem statement, we need to extract the book titles. Therefore, we need the `title` column from the `book` table.  4. **Filter the Data**:    - We need to filter the books to only those published by ""AK Press."" This requires us to use the `publisher_name` column from the `publisher` table to apply the filter.  5. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Using the identified relationships and required columns, we can construct an SQL query:      - Use an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `book` and `publisher` tables on the `publisher_id`.      - Select the `title` column from the `book` table.      - Apply a `WHERE` clause to filter for `publisher_name = 'AK Press'`.  6. **Write the SQL Query**:    - The final SQL query is:            SELECT T1.title      FROM book AS T1      INNER JOIN publisher AS T2 ON T1.publisher_id = T2.publisher_id      WHERE T2.publisher_name = 'AK Press'        By following these logical steps, we ensure that we accurately retrieve the titles of books published by ""AK Press"" from the database.",,

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: We need to find the customer who ordered the book with the lowest price. This involves identifying the book with the minimum price and then determining which customer ordered it.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**: From the schema, identify the tables that are relevant to the problem:    - `order_line`: Contains information about each book order, including the `book_id` and `price`.    - `cust_order`: Contains information about each order, including the `order_id` and `customer_id`.    - `customer`: Contains customer details, including `first_name` and `last_name`.  3. **Determine the Relationships**:    - `order_line` is linked to `cust_order` through `order_id`.    - `cust_order` is linked to `customer` through `customer_id`.  4. **Formulate the Query**:    - **Step 1**: Start by selecting the necessary columns from the `order_line` table, which includes `order_id` and `price`.    - **Step 2**: Join `order_line` with `cust_order` on `order_id` to get the `customer_id` associated with each order.    - **Step 3**: Join the result with the `customer` table on `customer_id` to get the customer's `first_name` and `last_name`.  5. **Filter and Sort the Data**:    - **Step 4**: Order the results by `price` in ascending order to bring the cheapest book order to the top.    - **Step 5**: Use `LIMIT 1` to select only the first record, which corresponds to the book with the lowest price.  6. **Write the SQL Query**:    - The final SQL query combines all these steps:            SELECT T3.first_name, T3.last_name       FROM order_line AS T1       INNER JOIN cust_order AS T2 ON T2.order_id = T1.order_id       INNER JOIN customer AS T3 ON T3.customer_id = T2.customer_id       ORDER BY T1.price ASC       LIMIT 1;        By following these logical steps, we can systematically approach the problem and construct a query that accurately identifies the customer who ordered the book with the cheapest price.",,

Here’s how we can approach the problem:  1. **Understand the Requirement**: We need to find the ISBNs of books purchased by a customer with the email 'fsier3e@ihg.com'. This means we need to link customer information to book purchases.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**: Based on the schema provided, the relevant tables for this query are:    - `customer`: To find the customer using their email.    - `cust_order`: To find orders placed by the customer.    - `order_line`: To find books associated with each order.    - `book`: To get the ISBNs of the books.  3. **Determine the Relationships**:    - The `customer` table can be linked to the `cust_order` table using `customer_id`.    - The `cust_order` table can be linked to the `order_line` table using `order_id`.    - The `order_line` table can be linked to the `book` table using `book_id`.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Start by selecting the `isbn13` from the `book` table since that is the final output we need.    - Use an `INNER JOIN` to link the `book` table with the `order_line` table on `book_id`.    - Continue with an `INNER JOIN` to link the `order_line` table with the `cust_order` table on `order_id`.    - Use another `INNER JOIN` to link the `cust_order` table with the `customer` table on `customer_id`.    - Apply a `WHERE` clause to filter the customer by the given email 'fsier3e@ihg.com'.  5. **Write the SQL Query**:        SELECT T1.isbn13    FROM book AS T1    INNER JOIN order_line AS T2 ON T1.book_id = T2.book_id    INNER JOIN cust_order AS T3 ON T3.order_id = T2.order_id    INNER JOIN customer AS T4 ON T4.customer_id = T3.customer_id    WHERE T4.email = 'fsier3e@ihg.com';      6. **Verify the Logic**:    - Ensure that each join correctly links the necessary tables to trace the path from the customer to the books.    - Confirm that the `WHERE` clause accurately filters the customer by email.

The final SQL query is:  SELECT T2.publisher_name  FROM book AS T1  INNER JOIN publisher AS T2  ON T1.publisher_id = T2.publisher_id  WHERE T1.isbn13 = 76092025986;   This query effectively retrieves the publisher name for the book with the given ISBN by leveraging the relationship between the `book` and `publisher` tables.",,

This can be done using the `STRFTIME` function to format the date and extract the year.  6. **Filter Books by Page Count:**    - Use a `WHERE` clause to filter books with `num_pages` between 600 and 700.  7. **Count the Number of Books:**    - Use the `COUNT(*)` function to count the number of books that meet all the specified criteria.  8. **Write the SQL Query:**    - Combine all the steps into a single SQL query that performs the necessary join, applies the filters, and counts the results.  Here is the final SQL query based on the above reasoning:   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM book AS T1 INNER JOIN publisher AS T2 ON T1.publisher_id = T2.publisher_id WHERE T2.publisher_name = 'Birlinn' AND STRFTIME('%Y', T1.publication_date) = '2008' AND T1.num_pages BETWEEN 600 AND 700;   This query will return the count of books published by ""Birlinn"" in 2008 with a page count between 600 and 700.",,

This requires identifying the relationship between orders and books.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**: From the schema provided, the tables that are relevant to solving this problem are:    - `cust_order`: Contains information about orders, including the `order_id`.    - `order_line`: Contains the `order_id` and `book_id`, linking orders to specific books.    - `book`: Contains details about books, including `book_id` and `num_pages`.  3. **Determine Table Relationships**:    - The `order_line` table acts as a bridge between the `cust_order` and `book` tables. It links each order to the specific books included in that order through the `order_id` and `book_id`.  4. **Formulate the Query**:    - **Join Tables**: We need to join the `book` table with the `order_line` table to access the `num_pages` of the book associated with a specific order.    - **Select the Required Information**: We are interested in the `num_pages` from the `book` table.    - **Apply the Condition**: We need to filter the results to only include the order with `order_id` 1167.  5. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Use an `INNER JOIN` to connect `book` and `order_line` on `book_id`.    - Use a `WHERE` clause to filter for `order_id` 1167.  The resulting SQL query is:  SELECT T1.num_pages  FROM book AS T1  INNER JOIN order_line AS T2  ON T1.book_id = T2.book_id  WHERE T2.order_id = 1167;   6. **Verify the Query**: Ensure the query correctly retrieves the number of pages for the book in the specified order by checking the logic of joins and conditions.  By following these steps, we can confidently retrieve the desired information from the database.",,

This means we need to identify books with a specific language attribute.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**:     - We need information about books, specifically their titles and the language they are published in.     - The `book` table contains the `title` and `language_id`.    - The `book_language` table contains `language_id`, `language_code`, and `language_name`.  3. **Determine the Relationship**:    - The `book` table and `book_language` table are related through the `language_id` column. This relationship allows us to join these tables to find out the language details for each book.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - We need to select the `title` from the `book` table where the `language_name` in the `book_language` table is 'British English'.    - Use an INNER JOIN to combine the `book` and `book_language` tables based on the `language_id`.  5. **Select Distinct Titles**:    - Since the requirement is to provide the titles, and there might be duplicates due to multiple entries or joins, use `SELECT DISTINCT` to ensure each title is listed only once.  6. **Write the SQL Query**:    - The SQL query is constructed as follows:            SELECT DISTINCT T1.title       FROM book AS T1       INNER JOIN book_language AS T2       ON T1.language_id = T2.language_id       WHERE T2.language_name = 'British English';          - This query selects distinct book titles where the language of the book is 'British English'.  7. **Verify the Logic**:    - Ensure that the join condition (`T1.language_id = T2.language_id`) correctly associates each book with its language.    - Confirm that the `WHERE` clause accurately filters for 'British English'.  By following these steps, we can logically derive the solution to the problem of retrieving book titles published in British-English.",,

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the thought process:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: We need to find the number of books published by a specific publisher, ""Brava,"" in the year 2006.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**: From the schema provided, the relevant tables for this query are:    - `book`: This table contains information about each book, including its publication date and publisher ID.    - `publisher`: This table contains information about publishers, including their names and IDs.  3. **Determine Necessary Columns**:    - From the `book` table, we need:      - `publication_date`: To filter books published in 2006.      - `publisher_id`: To join with the `publisher` table.    - From the `publisher` table, we need:      - `publisher_name`: To filter books published by ""Brava"".      - `publisher_id`: To join with the `book` table.  4. **Plan the Join Operation**: We need to join the `book` table with the `publisher` table using the `publisher_id` column, which is common to both tables. This will allow us to match each book with its corresponding publisher.  5. **Filter by Publisher Name**: After joining, we need to filter the results to include only those rows where the `publisher_name` is ""Brava"".  6. **Filter by Publication Year**: We need to extract the year from the `publication_date` column in the `book` table and filter the results to include only those books published in 2006. We can use the `STRFTIME` function to extract the year from the date.  7. **Count the Results**: Finally, we need to count the number of books that meet both criteria (published by ""Brava"" and in 2006). This can be done using the `COUNT(*)` function.  8. **Construct the SQL Query**: Based on the above steps, the SQL query is constructed as follows:        SELECT COUNT(*)    FROM book AS T1    INNER JOIN publisher AS T2 ON T1.publisher_id = T2.publisher_id    WHERE T2.publisher_name = 'Brava'    AND STRFTIME('%Y', T1.publication_date) = '2006'      By following these logical steps, we can systematically construct a query that answers the problem statement accurately.",,

The tables of interest are:    - `book`: Contains `book_id` and `isbn13`.    - `order_line`: Contains `book_id` and `price`.  3. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - From the `book` table, we need the `isbn13` column.    - From the `order_line` table, we need the `price` column.    - Both tables have a `book_id` column, which can be used to join them.  4. **Determine the Join Condition**: Since both tables contain the `book_id` column, we can use this column to join the `book` and `order_line` tables. This will allow us to combine the information from both tables for the specific book.  5. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Use an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `book` and `order_line` tables on the `book_id` column.    - Select the `isbn13` from the `book` table and the `price` from the `order_line` table.    - Apply a `WHERE` clause to filter for the specific `book_id` of 7160.  6. **Write the SQL Query**:        SELECT T1.isbn13, T2.price    FROM book AS T1    INNER JOIN order_line AS T2 ON T1.book_id = T2.book_id    WHERE T2.book_id = 7160;      7. **Verify the Solution**: Ensure the query accurately retrieves the desired information by checking the logic and the table relationships. The query should return the ISBN and price for the book with ID 7160.  By following these steps, you can logically arrive at the solution to the problem using the given schema and requirements.",,

This requires identifying the relationship between orders and books.  2. **Analyze the Schema**: Review the provided database schema to identify relevant tables and columns:    - The `cust_order` table contains order information, but it does not directly link to books.    - The `order_line` table links orders to books through `order_id` and `book_id`.    - The `book` table contains book details, including the `title` and `book_id`.  3. **Identify Key Tables and Columns**:    - `order_line`: This table is crucial because it connects `order_id` with `book_id`.    - `book`: This table contains the `title` of the book, which is the desired output.  4. **Determine the Relationships**:    - The `order_line` table acts as a bridge between the `cust_order` table and the `book` table. We can use `order_id` from `order_line` to find the corresponding `book_id`, which can then be used to retrieve the `title` from the `book` table.  5. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Start by selecting the `title` from the `book` table.    - Use an `INNER JOIN` to connect the `book` table with the `order_line` table on the `book_id`.    - Add a `WHERE` clause to filter the results to only include the specific `order_id` (931).  6. **Construct the Query**:    - The query should select the `title` from the `book` table where the `order_id` in the `order_line` table matches 931. This is achieved by joining `book` and `order_line` on `book_id`.  7. **Write the Final Query**:        SELECT T1.title    FROM book AS T1    INNER JOIN order_line AS T2 ON T1.book_id = T2.book_id    WHERE T2.order_id = 931;      By following these steps, we logically deduced how to retrieve the book title for a specific order ID using the given schema.",,

Here's how we can approach the problem:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement:**    - We need to find the language of a book with the title ""Zorro.""  2. **Identify Relevant Tables:**    - Based on the schema provided, the relevant tables are `book` and `book_language`.    - The `book` table contains information about books, including their titles and language IDs.    - The `book_language` table contains information about languages, including language IDs and language names.  3. **Determine the Relationship Between Tables:**    - The `book` table has a `language_id` column that can be used to link to the `book_language` table's `language_id` column.    - This relationship allows us to join the two tables to get the language name for a specific book.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query:**    - We need to select the `language_name` from the `book_language` table.    - To do this, we will perform an INNER JOIN between the `book` table and the `book_language` table on the `language_id` column.    - We will filter the results by specifying that the `title` in the `book` table should be ""Zorro.""  5. **Write the SQL Query:**    - The SQL query can be formulated as follows:            SELECT T2.language_name      FROM book AS T1      INNER JOIN book_language AS T2 ON T1.language_id = T2.language_id      WHERE T1.title = 'Zorro';          - This query selects the `language_name` from the `book_language` table where the `title` in the `book` table is ""Zorro.""  6. **Verify the Solution:**    - Ensure that the query correctly joins the tables and filters by the book title.    - Check that the query returns the expected result, which is the language of the book titled ""Zorro.""  By following these logical steps, we can systematically arrive at the solution to the SQL problem.",,

Here's how we can approach the problem:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: We need to find the ISBNs of books that have a specific price, which is 7.5 dollars. This means we are looking for a relationship between books and their prices.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**: From the schema, it is clear that the `book` table contains information about books, including their ISBNs. The `order_line` table contains information about the price of books in orders. Therefore, these two tables are likely to be relevant for solving the problem.  3. **Determine the Relationship Between Tables**: We need to find out how these tables are related. The `order_line` table has a `book_id` column, which suggests that it can be linked to the `book` table through the `book_id` column in the `book` table.  4. **Formulate the Join Condition**: To combine data from the `book` and `order_line` tables, we need to perform a join operation. The join condition will be based on the `book_id` column, which is common to both tables.  5. **Filter the Data Based on Price**: Once the tables are joined, we need to filter the results to only include rows where the price is 7.5 dollars. This can be done using a `WHERE` clause in the SQL query.  6. **Select the Required Output**: The final step is to select the `isbn13` column from the `book` table, as this is the information we need to output according to the problem statement.  7. **Write the SQL Query**: Based on the above steps, the SQL query can be constructed as follows:        SELECT T1.isbn13    FROM book AS T1    INNER JOIN order_line AS T2 ON T1.book_id = T2.book_id    WHERE T2.price = 7.5;      By following these logical steps, we can systematically arrive at the solution to the problem, ensuring that we correctly identify the necessary tables and columns, establish the appropriate relationships, and apply the correct filters to obtain the desired result.",,

We need to identify:    - The table that contains book details, including the number of pages (`book` table).    - The table that contains order details (`cust_order` table).    - The table that links orders to books (`order_line` table).    - The table that contains customer information (`customer` table).  3. **Determine the Relationships**:    - Books are linked to orders through the `order_line` table.    - Orders are linked to customers through the `cust_order` table.    - Customers are identified by their first and last names in the `customer` table.  4. **Plan the Joins**:    - Start with the `book` table to access the `num_pages` column.    - Join the `order_line` table to link books with orders using `book_id`.    - Join the `cust_order` table to link orders with customers using `order_id`.    - Join the `customer` table to filter the specific customer, Mick Sever, using `customer_id`.  5. **Filter by Customer Name**:    - Use a `WHERE` clause to filter the records for the customer with the first name ""Mick"" and last name ""Sever"".  6. **Calculate the Sum**:    - Use the `SUM` function to calculate the total number of pages of the books ordered by Mick Sever.  7. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Combine all the steps into a coherent SQL query:            SELECT SUM(T1.num_pages)      FROM book AS T1      INNER JOIN order_line AS T2 ON T1.book_id = T2.book_id      INNER JOIN cust_order AS T3 ON T3.order_id = T2.order_id      INNER JOIN customer AS T4 ON T4.customer_id = T3.customer_id      WHERE T4.first_name = 'Mick' AND T4.last_name = 'Sever';        By following these logical steps, we can systematically approach the problem and construct a query that accurately retrieves the desired information.",,

Here is a breakdown of the reasoning process:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: We need to calculate the percentage of books published by ""Ace Book"" that are in English. This involves identifying books published by Ace Book and determining how many of those are in English.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - We need information about books, their languages, and their publishers.    - The `book` table contains information about each book, including `language_id` and `publisher_id`.    - The `book_language` table provides the `language_name` corresponding to each `language_id`.    - The `publisher` table contains `publisher_name` for each `publisher_id`.  3. **Determine Necessary Joins**:    - To get the language of each book, join the `book` table with the `book_language` table on `language_id`.    - To filter books published by Ace Book, join the `book` table with the `publisher` table on `publisher_id`.  4. **Filter for Ace Book**:    - Use a `WHERE` clause to filter the results to only include books where the `publisher_name` is ""Ace Book"".  5. **Calculate the Percentage**:    - Use a `CASE` statement to count the number of books in English. Check if `language_name` is 'English'.    - Calculate the total number of books published by Ace Book using `COUNT(*)`.    - Compute the percentage by dividing the count of English books by the total number of books and multiplying by 100.  6. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Use `SUM(CASE WHEN T1.language_name = 'English' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)` to count English books.    - Use `COUNT(*)` to get the total number of books.    - Divide the count of English books by the total count and multiply by 100 to get the percentage.    - Ensure the division results in a real number by casting the numerator to `REAL`.  7. **Final SQL Query**:    - Combine all these steps into a single SQL query that performs the necessary joins, filtering, and calculations.  Here is the final SQL query based on the above reasoning:   SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN T1.language_name = 'English' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(*) FROM book_language AS T1 INNER JOIN book AS T2 ON T1.language_id = T2.language_id INNER JOIN publisher AS T3 ON T3.publisher_id = T2.publisher_id WHERE T3.publisher_name = 'Ace Book'   This query will yield the percentage of English books published by Ace Book.",,

This is done by checking the `price` column in the `order_line` table.  5. **Count Books Based on Page Numbers:**    - Use conditional aggregation to count books with less than 500 pages and books with more than 500 pages.    - Use `SUM` with a `CASE` statement to count books with `num_pages < 500` and another `SUM` with a `CASE` statement for books with `num_pages > 500`.  6. **Calculate the Difference:**    - Subtract the count of books with more than 500 pages from the count of books with less than 500 pages to find the required difference.  7. **Write the Final Query:**    - Combine all the above steps into a single SQL query:            SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN T1.num_pages < 500 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) - SUM(CASE WHEN T1.num_pages > 500 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS dif      FROM book AS T1      INNER JOIN order_line AS T2 ON T1.book_id = T2.book_id      WHERE T2.price < 1;        By following these steps, we ensure that we accurately filter, count, and compute the difference as required by the problem statement.",,

This means we need to filter the `employee` table to find the `employee_id` corresponding to Joshua Rosa.  3. **Filter Inspections by Employee**:    - Once we have Joshua Rosa's `employee_id`, we can filter the `inspection` table to find all inspections conducted by him. This is done by matching `employee_id` in the `inspection` table with Joshua's `employee_id`.  4. **Link Inspections to Establishments**:    - Each inspection is associated with an establishment via the `license_no`. We need to join the `inspection` table with the `establishment` table on `license_no` to retrieve the `dba_name` of the establishments inspected by Joshua Rosa.  5. **Select Distinct Facility Names**:    - Since a facility might be inspected multiple times, we should ensure that each facility name appears only once in the result. This can be achieved by using `SELECT DISTINCT`.  6. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Combine the above steps into a single SQL query:            SELECT DISTINCT T3.dba_name      FROM employee AS T1      INNER JOIN inspection AS T2 ON T1.employee_id = T2.employee_id      INNER JOIN establishment AS T3 ON T2.license_no = T3.license_no      WHERE T1.first_name = 'Joshua' AND T1.last_name = 'Rosa'          - This query joins the `employee` table with the `inspection` table to filter inspections by Joshua Rosa, then joins with the `establishment` table to get the facility names, and finally selects distinct facility names.

Here are the logical steps to reach the solution:  1. **Understand the Schema and Problem Requirements**:     - We have three relevant tables: `inspection`, `establishment`, and potentially `violation` (though not used in the solution).    - We need to find facilities inspected in 2010 and check if they are restaurants or cafeterias.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - From the `inspection` table, we need `inspection_date` to filter inspections in 2010 and `license_no` to identify the facility.    - From the `establishment` table, we need `facility_type` to check if the facility is a restaurant or cafeteria and `license_no` to join with the `inspection` table.  3. **Determine the Join Condition**:    - The common column between `inspection` and `establishment` is `license_no`. We will use this to join the tables.  4. **Filter Inspections for the Year 2010**:    - Use the `inspection_date` column from the `inspection` table to filter records. We need to extract the year from this date and check if it equals 2010.  5. **Filter for Restaurants or Cafeterias**:    - From the `establishment` table, use the `facility_type` column to filter facilities that are either 'Restaurant' or 'Cafeteria'.  6. **Count Unique Facilities**:    - Since we want to know how many unique facilities meet the criteria, we need to count distinct `license_no` values after applying the filters.  7. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Use an `INNER JOIN` to combine `inspection` and `establishment` tables based on `license_no`.    - Apply the `WHERE` clause to filter inspections in 2010 and facilities that are restaurants or cafeterias.    - Use `COUNT(DISTINCT license_no)` to get the number of unique facilities.  8. **Write the Final SQL Query**:    - The final query should look like this:            SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT T1.license_no)      FROM inspection AS T1      INNER JOIN establishment AS T2 ON T1.license_no = T2.license_no      WHERE strftime('%Y', T1.inspection_date) = '2010'      AND T2.facility_type = 'Restaurant'          - Note: The query provided in the solution only checks for 'Restaurant'.

Here are the logical steps to arrive at the solution:  1. **Understand the Schema and Problem Requirements:**    - We need to find the latitude and longitude of facilities.    - The inspection date of interest is 2010/5/11.    - The relevant tables are `inspection` (which contains inspection details including dates and license numbers) and `establishment` (which contains the location details including latitude and longitude).  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns:**    - From the `inspection` table, we need the `inspection_date` and `license_no` columns.    - From the `establishment` table, we need the `latitude` and `longitude` columns.  3. **Determine the Relationship Between Tables:**    - The `inspection` table and the `establishment` table are related by the `license_no` column. This allows us to join these tables to match inspections with their corresponding facilities.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query:**    - Start by selecting the columns of interest: `latitude` and `longitude`.    - Use an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `inspection` and `establishment` tables on the `license_no` column. This ensures we only get records where there is a match between inspections and establishments.    - Add a `WHERE` clause to filter records where the `inspection_date` is 2010/5/11.  5. **Ensure Unique Results:**    - Use `DISTINCT` to ensure that the result set contains unique latitude and longitude pairs. This is important in case multiple inspections occurred at the same facility on the same day.  6. **Write the Final SQL Query:**    - The query becomes:            SELECT DISTINCT T2.latitude, T2.longitude      FROM inspection AS T1      INNER JOIN establishment AS T2 ON T1.license_no = T2.license_no      WHERE T1.inspection_date = '2010-05-11'        By following these steps, we ensure that we accurately retrieve the location coordinates of facilities inspected on the specified date.",,

Here are the logical steps to arrive at the solution:  1. **Understand the Schema and Problem Requirements**:    - We have three relevant tables: `inspection`, `establishment`, and `inspection_point`.    - The `inspection` table contains information about inspections, including `inspection_date` and `license_no`.    - The `establishment` table contains information about facilities, including `ward` and `license_no`.    - We need to find facilities in ward no. 42 that have had inspections in 2010.  2. **Identify the Necessary Data**:    - We need to filter inspections that occurred in the year 2010. This information is in the `inspection` table under the `inspection_date` column.    - We need to know which facilities are in ward no. 42. This information is in the `establishment` table under the `ward` column.    - We need to link inspections to facilities using the `license_no` column, which is common to both the `inspection` and `establishment` tables.  3. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - **Join the Tables**: Use an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `inspection` and `establishment` tables based on the `license_no` column. This will allow us to associate each inspection with its corresponding facility.    - **Filter by Year**: Use the `strftime` function to extract the year from the `inspection_date` and filter for the year 2010.    - **Filter by Ward**: Add a condition to filter facilities that are in ward no. 42.    - **Count Unique Facilities**: Use `COUNT(DISTINCT T1.license_no)` to count the number of unique facilities that meet the criteria.  4. **Write the SQL Query**:    - The final SQL query is:            SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT T1.license_no)      FROM inspection AS T1      INNER JOIN establishment AS T2 ON T1.license_no = T2.license_no      WHERE strftime('%Y', T1.inspection_date) = '2010'      AND T2.ward = 42;        5. **Verify the Solution**:    - Ensure that the query correctly joins the tables and applies the necessary filters.    - Double-check that the `COUNT(DISTINCT T1.license_no)` correctly counts unique facilities.

This requires a condition on `establishment.dba_name`.    - We also need to ensure that only employees with the title ""Sanitarian"" are included, which requires a condition on `employee.title`.  5. **Select the Required Columns:**    - We are interested in the full names of the sanitarians, so we need to select `first_name` and `last_name` from the `employee` table.  6. **Ensure Unique Results:**    - Use `DISTINCT` to ensure that each sanitarian's name appears only once, even if they have conducted multiple inspections at ""Burbank.""  7. **Formulate the SQL Query:**    - Combine all the above steps into a coherent SQL query:        SELECT DISTINCT T1.first_name, T1.last_name    FROM employee AS T1    INNER JOIN inspection AS T2 ON T1.employee_id = T2.employee_id    INNER JOIN establishment AS T3 ON T2.license_no = T3.license_no    WHERE T3.dba_name = 'Burbank' AND T1.title = 'Sanitarian';      By following these logical steps, we can construct a query that accurately retrieves the desired information from the database.",,

The key information required is the facility name and the inspection result.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - The `inspection` table contains information about inspection results and dates.    - The `establishment` table contains information about facilities, including their names (`dba_name` and `aka_name`).  3. **Determine the Key Relationships**:    - The `inspection` table is related to the `establishment` table through the `license_no` column. This relationship allows us to link inspection results to specific facilities.  4. **Filter Inspections by Result and Date**:    - We need to filter inspections where the `results` column is 'Fail'.    - Additionally, we need to filter inspections that occurred in the year 2010. This can be done by extracting the year from the `inspection_date` column.  5. **Join Tables to Access Facility Names**:    - Use an INNER JOIN to combine the `inspection` and `establishment` tables based on the `license_no` column. This will allow us to access the facility names for the inspections that meet our criteria.  6. **Select the Required Columns**:    - We are interested in the `dba_name` from the `establishment` table, which represents the assumed name of the facility.  7. **Ensure Unique Results**:    - Use `DISTINCT` to ensure that each facility name is listed only once, even if it failed multiple inspections in 2010.  8. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Combine all the steps into a coherent SQL query:            SELECT DISTINCT T2.dba_name      FROM inspection AS T1      INNER JOIN establishment AS T2 ON T1.license_no = T2.license_no      WHERE T1.results = 'Fail'      AND strftime('%Y', T1.inspection_date) = '2010'        By following these logical steps, we can systematically arrive at the solution to the problem, ensuring that all necessary conditions are met and the correct data is retrieved.",,

This relationship allows us to link inspections to the specific employee who conducted them.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query:**    - Start by selecting the necessary columns. We need to count the number of inspections, so we will use `COUNT(T2.inspection_id)`.    - Use an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `employee` and `inspection` tables on the `employee_id` column. This will allow us to filter inspections based on the employee's name.    - Apply the `WHERE` clause to filter for inspections conducted by Joshua Rosa. This involves checking for `T1.first_name = 'Joshua'` and `T1.last_name = 'Rosa'`.    - Further filter the results to only include inspections with a result of ""pass"" using `T2.results = 'Pass'`.  5. **Write the Final SQL Query:**    - The final SQL query is:            SELECT COUNT(T2.inspection_id)      FROM employee AS T1      INNER JOIN inspection AS T2 ON T1.employee_id = T2.employee_id      WHERE T2.results = 'Pass'      AND T1.first_name = 'Joshua'      AND T1.last_name = 'Rosa';        6. **Verify the Solution:**    - Ensure that the query correctly counts only those inspections conducted by Joshua Rosa that have a result of ""pass.""

Here are the logical steps to reach the solution:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement:**    - We need to find the date of the follow-up inspection for Azha Restaurant Inc. after it passed the inspection on 2010/1/21.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns:**    - The `establishment` table contains information about the restaurant, including its name (`dba_name`).    - The `inspection` table contains information about inspections, including `inspection_date`, `results`, `license_no`, and `followup_to`.  3. **Determine the Relationship Between Tables:**    - The `inspection` table has a `license_no` column that can be used to join with the `establishment` table to find inspections related to Azha Restaurant Inc.  4. **Formulate the Query:**    - We need to find inspections for Azha Restaurant Inc. where the result was 'Pass' and the inspection date was '2010-01-21'.    - We are interested in the `followup_to` column from the `inspection` table, which indicates the follow-up inspection.  5. **Write the SQL Query:**    - Use an `INNER JOIN` to connect the `inspection` table with the `establishment` table on `license_no`.    - Filter the results to only include rows where `dba_name` is 'Azha Restaurant Inc.', `results` is 'Pass', and `inspection_date` is '2010-01-21'.    - Select the `followup_to` column to get the follow-up inspection date.  6. **Execute the Query:**    - The final SQL query is:            SELECT T1.followup_to       FROM inspection AS T1       INNER JOIN establishment AS T2       ON T1.license_no = T2.license_no       WHERE T2.dba_name = 'Azha Restaurant Inc.'       AND T1.results = 'Pass'       AND T1.inspection_date = '2010-01-21';        7. **Interpret the Results:**    - The query will return the date of the follow-up inspection for Azha Restaurant Inc. after it passed the inspection on 2010/1/21.  By following these logical steps, we can systematically approach the problem and construct a query that provides the desired information.",,

This can be achieved by filtering the `inspection_date` column.    - Use a date function like `strftime('%Y', T1.inspection_date)` to extract the year from the inspection date and compare it to '2010'.  4. **Join Tables**:    - To link inspections to establishments, perform an inner join between the `inspection` table and the `establishment` table on the `license_no` column.    - This join allows us to access the `risk_level` of each establishment that had an inspection in 2010.  5. **Filter by Most Serious Risk Level**:    - Determine what constitutes the ""most serious"" food safety issues. Assuming `risk_level = 3` represents the most serious issues, filter the results by this risk level.  6. **Count Distinct Establishments**:    - Since the question asks for the number of facilities, count the distinct `license_no` values from the filtered results to ensure each facility is only counted once, regardless of the number of inspections.  7. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Combine all the above steps into a single SQL query:            SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT T2.license_no)      FROM inspection AS T1      INNER JOIN establishment AS T2 ON T1.license_no = T2.license_no      WHERE strftime('%Y', T1.inspection_date) = '2010'      AND T2.risk_level = 3;        By following these steps, we can logically derive the solution to the problem and ensure that we accurately count the number of facilities with the most serious food safety issues that were inspected in 2010.",,

Here are the logical steps to reach the solution:  1. **Understand the Problem**:     - We need to calculate the average number of inspections conducted by sanitarians in 2010.    - The sanitarians of interest are those with a salary greater than 70,000.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - The `employee` table contains information about employees, including their `employee_id`, `title`, and `salary`.    - The `inspection` table contains information about inspections, including `inspection_date` and `employee_id`.  3. **Filter Employees by Title and Salary**:    - We are interested in employees with the title ""Sanitarian"" and a salary greater than 70,000.    - Although the title is not used in the final query, it's implicitly understood that we are dealing with sanitarians.  4. **Join Tables**:    - We need to join the `employee` table with the `inspection` table using the `employee_id` to associate each inspection with the corresponding employee.  5. **Filter Inspections by Year**:    - We need to filter inspections that occurred in the year 2010. This can be done by checking if the `inspection_date` starts with '2010'.  6. **Count Inspections**:    - For each inspection in 2010, we count it if it was conducted by an employee with a salary over 70,000.  7. **Calculate the Average**:    - The average number of inspections is calculated by dividing the total number of inspections in 2010 by the number of sanitarians with a salary over 70,000.  8. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Use a `CASE` statement to count inspections in 2010.    - Use another `CASE` statement to count sanitarians with a salary over 70,000.    - Use `SUM` to aggregate these counts.    - Divide the total number of inspections by the number of sanitarians to get the average.  9. **Write the SQL Query**:        SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN T2.inspection_date LIKE '2010%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) /            SUM(CASE WHEN T1.salary > 70000 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)     FROM employee AS T1     INNER JOIN inspection AS T2 ON T1.employee_id = T2.employee_id;      10. **Verify the Solution**:     - Ensure that the query correctly filters and calculates the average as per the problem requirements.

By following these logical steps, we can systematically arrive at the solution to count the number of inspections for ""All Style Buffet Restaurant"".",,

Here's how you can approach this problem:  1. **Understand the Schema and Problem Requirements**:    - We need to find the first inspection date for a specific restaurant, ""Wing Hung Chop Suey Restaurant.""    - The relevant tables are `establishment` and `inspection`.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - The `establishment` table contains information about different establishments, including their names and license numbers.    - The `inspection` table contains inspection records, including inspection dates and the license numbers of establishments.  3. **Determine the Relationship Between Tables**:    - The `establishment` table and the `inspection` table are related through the `license_no` column. This column acts as a foreign key in the `inspection` table, linking each inspection to a specific establishment.  4. **Formulate the Query**:    - We need to find the earliest inspection date for ""Wing Hung Chop Suey Restaurant."" This requires filtering the `establishment` table to find the specific restaurant and then joining it with the `inspection` table to access the inspection dates.  5. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Start by selecting the minimum inspection date from the `inspection` table, which will give us the earliest inspection date.    - Use an INNER JOIN to connect the `establishment` table with the `inspection` table on the `license_no` column.    - Add a WHERE clause to filter the `establishment` table to only include records where the `aka_name` is ""WING HUNG CHOP SUEY RESTAURANT.""  6. **Construct the Final SQL Query**:        SELECT MIN(T2.inspection_date)    FROM establishment AS T1    INNER JOIN inspection AS T2 ON T1.license_no = T2.license_no    WHERE T1.aka_name = 'WING HUNG CHOP SUEY RESTAURANT';      7. **Verify the Query**:    - Ensure that the query correctly identifies the first inspection date by checking that the join and filter conditions are correctly specified.    - Validate the query against sample data, if available, to confirm it returns the expected result.

We need to focus on the `inspection`, `inspection_point`, and `violation` tables since they contain information about inspections, the points of inspection, and violations.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - **`inspection` table**: Contains `inspection_id` which can be linked to the `violation` table.    - **`violation` table**: Contains `inspection_id` and `point_id`, which can be linked to the `inspection_point` table.    - **`inspection_point` table**: Contains `point_id` and `category`, which will help us filter for ""Food Maintenance"" related violations.  3. **Determine the Relationships**:    - The `violation` table can be joined with the `inspection_point` table using the `point_id` column.    - The `violation` table can be filtered using the `inspection_id` column to focus on inspection no. 1454071.  4. **Formulate the Query**:    - Start by joining the `violation` table with the `inspection_point` table on the `point_id` to access the `category` of each violation.    - Filter the results to include only those violations where `inspection_id` is 1454071 and the `category` is ""Food Maintenance"".    - Count the number of violations that meet these criteria.  5. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Use an INNER JOIN to combine the `violation` and `inspection_point` tables on `point_id`.    - Apply a WHERE clause to filter for `inspection_id = 1454071` and `category = 'Food Maintenance'`.    - Use the COUNT function to count the number of matching violations.  6. **Construct the Final Query**:        SELECT COUNT(T2.point_id)    FROM inspection_point AS T1    INNER JOIN violation AS T2 ON T1.point_id = T2.point_id    WHERE T2.inspection_id = '1454071' AND T1.category = 'Food Maintenance';      By following these steps, we logically deduce how to extract and count the relevant violations for the given inspection.",,

Here's a breakdown of the thought process:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to find the number of inspections for a specific grocery store at a given address.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - From the schema provided, we identify that the `establishment` table contains information about the grocery store, including its address and license number.    - The `inspection` table contains information about inspections, including inspection IDs and the license number of the establishment inspected.  3. **Determine the Relationship Between Tables**:    - The `establishment` table and the `inspection` table can be linked through the `license_no` column. This is a common key that allows us to join these tables.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - We need to count the number of inspections, which suggests using the `COUNT()` function on the `inspection_id` column in the `inspection` table.    - To find the inspections for the specific grocery store, we need to filter the `establishment` table by the given address ""3635 W DIVERSEY AVE"".    - Additionally, we need to ensure that the establishment is a ""Grocery Store"" by checking the `facility_type` column.  5. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Start with a `SELECT` statement to count the number of inspections.    - Use an `INNER JOIN` to connect the `establishment` and `inspection` tables on the `license_no` column.    - Apply a `WHERE` clause to filter the establishments by the specific address and facility type.  6. **Write the Final SQL Query**:    - The final query should look like this:            SELECT COUNT(T2.inspection_id)      FROM establishment AS T1      INNER JOIN inspection AS T2 ON T1.license_no = T2.license_no      WHERE T1.address = '3635 W DIVERSEY AVE'      AND T1.facility_type = 'Grocery Store'        7. **Verify the Query**:    - Ensure that the query logically makes sense and that all conditions are correctly specified to filter the data as required.    - Check if there are any additional constraints or details in the problem statement that need to be addressed.

This requires counting the number of inspections each employee has performed.  3. **Join the Tables**:    - Since the `inspection` table contains the `employee_id`, we can join it with the `employee` table to access employee details such as `first_name` and `last_name`.  4. **Count Inspections per Employee**:    - Use the `COUNT()` function on `inspection_id` to count the number of inspections each employee has conducted.    - Group the results by `employee_id` to ensure the count is calculated per employee.  5. **Sort to Find the Maximum**:    - Order the results by the count of inspections in descending order to bring the employee with the most inspections to the top.  6. **Select the Top Result**:    - Use `LIMIT 1` to select only the top result, which corresponds to the employee with the highest number of inspections.  7. **Retrieve the Full Name**:    - Select the `first_name` and `last_name` of the employee from the joined tables to retrieve the full name of the employee responsible for the most inspections.  By following these steps, we can construct the SQL query to solve the problem:   SELECT T.first_name, T.last_name  FROM (     SELECT T2.employee_id, T2.first_name, T2.last_name, COUNT(T1.inspection_id)      FROM inspection AS T1      INNER JOIN employee AS T2 ON T1.employee_id = T2.employee_id      GROUP BY T2.employee_id, T2.first_name, T2.last_name      ORDER BY COUNT(T1.inspection_id) DESC      LIMIT 1 ) AS T   This query effectively identifies the employee who has conducted the most inspections and retrieves their full name.",,

This requires checking `first_name` and `last_name` in the `employee` table.    - Further filter the results to only include inspections with the result ""Out of Business"" from the `inspection` table.  6. **Count the Results**:    - Use the `COUNT()` function to count the number of inspections that meet the criteria.  7. **Construct the Final Query**:    - Combine all the steps into a single SQL query:            SELECT COUNT(T1.inspection_id)      FROM inspection AS T1      INNER JOIN employee AS T2 ON T1.employee_id = T2.employee_id      WHERE T2.first_name = 'Lisa'      AND T2.last_name = 'Tillman'      AND T1.results = 'Out of Business';        8. **Verify the Query**:    - Double-check the logic and ensure that the query correctly implements all the necessary conditions to solve the problem.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logical reasoning process to arrive at the solution:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to find the phone number of the sanitarian responsible for a specific inspection, identified by inspection_id 634597.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - From the schema, we identify that the `inspection` table contains information about inspections, including the `inspection_id` and the `employee_id` of the responsible employee.    - The `employee` table contains details about employees, including their `employee_id`, `phone`, and `title` (which should be 'Sanitarian' for this problem).  3. **Determine the Relationship Between Tables**:    - The `inspection` table and the `employee` table can be linked through the `employee_id` column, which is common to both tables.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - We need to retrieve the phone number from the `employee` table where the `employee_id` matches the one in the `inspection` table for inspection_id 634597.    - Additionally, we need to ensure that the employee's title is 'Sanitarian'.  5. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Use an INNER JOIN to combine the `inspection` and `employee` tables based on the `employee_id`.    - Filter the results to include only the inspection with `inspection_id` 634597.    - Further filter to ensure the employee's title is 'Sanitarian'.    - Select the `phone` column from the `employee` table.  6. **Write the SQL Query**:        SELECT T2.phone     FROM inspection AS T1     INNER JOIN employee AS T2     ON T1.employee_id = T2.employee_id     WHERE T1.inspection_id = 634597     AND T2.title = 'Sanitarian';      7. **Verify the Solution**:    - Ensure that the query correctly joins the tables and applies the necessary filters.    - Confirm that the query retrieves the correct phone number for the sanitarian responsible for the specified inspection.  By following these logical steps, we can confidently construct and understand the SQL query that solves the problem.",,

This will allow us to associate each inspection with its corresponding establishment.  5. **Filter Data**:    - Apply a WHERE clause to filter the results to only include establishments that are taverns (`facility_type = 'TAVERN'`) and have a risk level of 3 (`risk_level = 3`).  6. **Calculate the Average Number of Inspections**:    - Count the total number of inspections for the filtered establishments.    - Count the distinct number of taverns (distinct `license_no`) to determine how many taverns are being considered.    - Calculate the average by dividing the total number of inspections by the number of distinct taverns.  7. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Use the COUNT function to count the total number of inspections (`COUNT(T2.inspection_id)`).    - Use COUNT(DISTINCT T1.license_no) to count the number of distinct taverns.    - Divide the total number of inspections by the number of taverns to get the average.    - Ensure the division results in a real number by casting the count as REAL.  8. **Write the Final SQL Query**:        SELECT CAST(COUNT(T2.inspection_id) AS REAL) / COUNT(DISTINCT T1.license_no)    FROM establishment AS T1    INNER JOIN inspection AS T2 ON T1.license_no = T2.license_no    WHERE T1.risk_level = 3 AND T1.facility_type = 'TAVERN';      By following these steps, we ensure that we accurately calculate the average number of inspections for risk level 3 taverns using the given schema and problem statement.",,

The problem asks for the ""assumed name,"" which typically refers to the ""doing business as"" (DBA) name.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**: From the schema provided, the `establishment` table is the most relevant because it contains columns related to business names (`dba_name`, `aka_name`) and addresses.  3. **Focus on the Address**: Since the problem specifies an address, we should look for a column in the `establishment` table that stores addresses. This column is named `address`.  4. **Filter by Address**: We need to filter the records in the `establishment` table where the `address` column matches '2903 W Irving Park Rd'. This will help us locate the specific business at that address.  5. **Select the DBA Name**: Once we have filtered the records by address, we should select the `dba_name` column, as this represents the assumed name or the name under which the business operates.  6. **Ensure Uniqueness**: Since the problem asks for the assumed name, we should ensure that we retrieve distinct values to avoid duplicates. This can be done using the `DISTINCT` keyword.  7. **Formulate the SQL Query**: Based on the above steps, the SQL query becomes:        SELECT DISTINCT dba_name FROM establishment WHERE address = '2903 W IRVING PARK RD'      8. **Verify the Solution**: Ensure that the query logically aligns with the problem requirements and that the `establishment` table indeed contains the necessary data to retrieve the assumed name for the given address.  By following these steps, we can systematically arrive at the solution to the problem.",,

This requires us to focus on the `employee` table, as it contains the relevant information about employees, including their salaries.  2. **Identify Relevant Data**: From the schema provided, identify the columns in the `employee` table that are necessary for solving the problem:    - `first_name`: To get the first name of the employee.    - `last_name`: To get the last name of the employee.    - `salary`: To determine the salary of each employee and identify the lowest one.  3. **Determine the Sorting Criteria**: Since we need to find the employee with the lowest salary, we should sort the employees based on their `salary` in ascending order. This way, the employee with the lowest salary will appear at the top of the sorted list.  4. **Limit the Result**: Once the employees are sorted by salary in ascending order, we only need the top result, as it represents the employee with the lowest salary. Therefore, we use a `LIMIT 1` clause to restrict the output to just one record.  5. **Construct the SQL Query**: With the above steps in mind, construct the SQL query:    - Use `SELECT` to specify the columns `first_name` and `last_name` that we want to retrieve.    - Use `FROM employee` to indicate the table from which we are selecting data.    - Use `ORDER BY salary ASC` to sort the employees by salary in ascending order.    - Use `LIMIT 1` to ensure that only the employee with the lowest salary is returned.  6. **Review and Execute the Query**: Review the constructed SQL query to ensure it aligns with the problem requirements and then execute it to obtain the desired result.  By following these logical steps, we arrive at the solution:  SELECT first_name, last_name FROM employee ORDER BY salary ASC LIMIT 1;  This query efficiently retrieves the full name of the employee with the lowest salary from the `employee` table.",,

Here are the logical steps to arrive at the solution:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to count the number of inspections that have critical food safety problems under a specific inspection point ID, which is 3.  2. **Review the Schema**:    - Identify the relevant tables and columns that might contain the necessary information.    - The `violation` table contains `inspection_id`, `point_id`, and `fine` columns which are crucial for identifying violations related to specific inspection points.    - The `inspection_point` table contains `point_id` and `point_level`, where we can verify if the point level is ""Critical"".  3. **Identify the Relevant Tables**:    - The `violation` table is directly related to the problem as it contains records of violations, including the `point_id` and `fine`.    - The `inspection_point` table helps verify that the point ID 3 corresponds to a critical level, but since all point levels are marked as ""Critical"" in the sample data, this step is implicit.  4. **Determine the Conditions for Filtering**:    - We need to filter the records in the `violation` table where `point_id` equals 3.    - Additionally, the problem implies that these are critical violations, which are associated with a `fine` of 500, as per the `inspection_point` table's sample data.  5. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Use the `COUNT` function to count the number of `inspection_id` entries in the `violation` table that meet the specified conditions.    - The SQL query should filter records where `point_id` is 3 and `fine` is 500.  6. **Write the SQL Query**:        SELECT COUNT(inspection_id)     FROM violation     WHERE point_id = 3 AND fine = 500;      7. **Verify the Solution**:    - Ensure that the query accurately reflects the problem statement by checking that it counts the correct number of inspections with critical violations under inspection point ID 3.

The `supervisor` column is key here as it indicates the employee ID of the supervisor for each employee.  2. **Identify Key Information**: Recognize that the task is to count the number of employees supervised by Gregory Cardenas. This means we need to find Gregory Cardenas's `employee_id` first, as it will be used to filter employees under his supervision.  3. **Locate Gregory Cardenas's Employee ID**:    - Use a subquery to find the `employee_id` of Gregory Cardenas. This involves selecting from the `employee` table where `first_name` is 'Gregory' and `last_name` is 'Cardenas'.    - The SQL for this step is:             SELECT employee_id FROM employee WHERE first_name = 'Gregory' AND last_name = 'Cardenas'        4. **Count Employees Under Gregory Cardenas**:    - Once we have Gregory Cardenas's `employee_id`, use it to filter the `employee` table to find all employees who have this ID as their `supervisor`.    - Count the number of such employees using the `COUNT()` function.    - The SQL for this step is:            SELECT COUNT(T1.employee_id) FROM employee AS T1 WHERE T1.supervisor = (SELECT employee_id FROM employee WHERE first_name = 'Gregory' AND last_name = 'Cardenas')        5. **Combine Steps into a Single Query**: Integrate the subquery from step 3 into the main query in step 4 to create a complete SQL query that directly provides the count of employees under Gregory Cardenas.  6. **Verify the Solution**: Ensure the query logic aligns with the problem statement and verify against sample data if possible to confirm accuracy.  By following these steps, you can logically derive the solution to the problem using SQL.",,

This involves identifying the relevant tables and columns that contain information about establishments and their inspections.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**:    - The `establishment` table contains information about businesses, including their `dba_name` (doing business as name) and `license_no`.    - The `inspection` table contains inspection records, including `inspection_date` and `license_no`.  3. **Determine the Relationship Between Tables**:    - The `establishment` and `inspection` tables can be linked via the `license_no` column, which is common to both tables. This allows us to associate each inspection with the corresponding establishment.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - **Select the Minimum Inspection Date**: Since we need the first inspection date, we should use the `MIN()` function on the `inspection_date` column to find the earliest date.    - **Join the Tables**: Use an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `establishment` and `inspection` tables on the `license_no` column. This ensures that we only consider inspections related to the establishments.    - **Filter for Renaldi's Pizza**: Add a `WHERE` clause to filter the results to only include rows where the `dba_name` is 'RENALDI''S PIZZA'. Note the use of two single quotes to escape the apostrophe in SQL.  5. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - The query should select the minimum inspection date from the joined tables, filtered by the specific establishment name.  Here is the SQL query that implements these steps:   SELECT MIN(T2.inspection_date) FROM establishment AS T1 INNER JOIN inspection AS T2 ON T1.license_no = T2.license_no WHERE T1.dba_name = 'RENALDI''S PIZZA';   6. **Verify the Query**:    - Ensure that the query correctly joins the tables and filters the results to only include inspections for Renaldi's Pizza.    - Verify that the `MIN()` function is correctly applied to the `inspection_date` to retrieve the earliest date.  By following these logical steps, we can confidently determine the first inspection date for Renaldi's Pizza using the given database schema.",,

Additionally, use the `employee_id` if provided (153225 in this case) for more precise filtering.    - **Filter by Inspection Type and Result**: In the `inspection` table, filter for `inspection_type` as ""Short Form Complaint"" and `results` as ""Pass"".    - **Count Distinct Businesses**: Use `COUNT(DISTINCT license_no)` to count the number of unique businesses that passed the inspection.  4. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - The query should select the count of distinct `license_no` from the `inspection` table after applying the necessary filters.    - Join the `employee` and `inspection` tables on `employee_id`.    - Apply the filters for David Hodges, inspection type, and results.  5. **Final SQL Query**:        SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT T2.license_no)    FROM employee AS T1    INNER JOIN inspection AS T2 ON T1.employee_id = T2.employee_id    WHERE T1.first_name = 'David'      AND T1.last_name = 'Hodges'      AND T1.employee_id = 153225      AND T2.inspection_type = 'Short Form Complaint'      AND T2.results = 'Pass';      6. **Verify and Test the Query**:    - Ensure the query logic aligns with the problem requirements.    - Test the query with sample data to verify its correctness.

Here is a step-by-step logical breakdown of how to approach this problem:  1. **Understand the Schema and Relationships**:    - We have three relevant tables: `establishment`, `inspection`, and `violation`.    - The `establishment` table contains business information, including `license_no` and `ward`.    - The `inspection` table contains inspection results, including `inspection_date`, `results`, and `license_no`.    - The `violation` table is not directly needed for this problem since we are focusing on inspection results.  2. **Identify the Key Requirements**:    - We need to focus on businesses in ward 42.    - We are interested in inspection results that are 'Fail'.    - We need to count businesses with at least 5 failed inspections within the specified date range (1/1/2010 to 12/31/2015).  3. **Filter Inspections by Date and Result**:    - Start by filtering the `inspection` table to include only records where the `inspection_date` is between '2010-01-01' and '2015-12-31' and the `results` is 'Fail'.  4. **Group and Count Failed Inspections**:    - Group the filtered inspection records by `license_no` and count the number of failed inspections for each business.    - Use a `HAVING` clause to filter groups with a count of failed inspections greater than or equal to 5.  5. **Identify Relevant Businesses**:    - From the previous step, we have a list of `license_no` values for businesses with at least 5 failed inspections.    - We need to ensure these businesses are in ward 42. This requires joining the filtered results with the `establishment` table on `license_no`.  6. **Filter by Ward**:    - Use an `INNER JOIN` between the `establishment` and filtered inspection results to ensure the businesses are in ward 42.  7. **Count Distinct Businesses**:    - Finally, count the distinct `license_no` values from the joined result to get the number of unique businesses that meet all criteria.  8. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Combine all the above steps into a single SQL query:            SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT T1.license_no)      FROM establishment AS T1      INNER JOIN inspection AS T2 ON T1.license_no = T2.license_no      WHERE T2.inspection_date BETWEEN '2010-01-01' AND '2015-12-31'        AND T1.ward = 42        AND T1.license_no IN (          SELECT license_no          FROM (            SELECT license_no            FROM inspection            WHERE results = 'Fail'            GROUP BY license_no            HAVING COUNT(results) >= 5          )        );        By following these steps, we ensure that the query accurately counts the number of businesses in ward 42 with at least 5 failed inspections within the specified timeframe.",,

Here's how you might approach the problem:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to find the salary of the employee who has performed the most inspections.     - This involves two main tasks: identifying the employee with the most inspections and retrieving their salary.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - The `inspection` table contains records of inspections, including the `employee_id` of the inspector.    - The `employee` table contains employee details, including `employee_id` and `salary`.  3. **Determine the Key Operations**:    - We need to count the number of inspections each employee has conducted.    - We need to find the employee with the maximum number of inspections.    - We need to retrieve the salary of this employee.  4. **Formulate the Subquery**:    - Start by writing a subquery to count the number of inspections per employee.    - Use `GROUP BY` on `employee_id` to aggregate the inspections.    - Use `COUNT(inspection_id)` to count the inspections for each employee.    - Order the results by the count in descending order to bring the employee with the most inspections to the top.    - Use `LIMIT 1` to select only the top result, which is the employee with the highest number of inspections.         SELECT employee_id, COUNT(inspection_id)     FROM inspection     GROUP BY employee_id     ORDER BY COUNT(inspection_id) DESC     LIMIT 1      5. **Join the Subquery with the Employee Table**:    - Use the result of the subquery to join with the `employee` table.    - This join will be on `employee_id` to match the employee with the most inspections to their salary.    - The `INNER JOIN` ensures we only get the relevant employee's record.  6. **Select the Desired Information**:    - From the joined result, select the `salary` column from the `employee` table.         SELECT T1.salary     FROM employee AS T1     INNER JOIN (        SELECT employee_id, COUNT(inspection_id)         FROM inspection         GROUP BY employee_id         ORDER BY COUNT(inspection_id) DESC         LIMIT 1    ) AS T2     ON T1.employee_id = T2.employee_id      7. **Review and Validate the Solution**:    - Ensure the query logic aligns with the problem requirements.    - Validate the query by testing it on sample data to ensure it returns the correct salary.  By following these steps, you can logically derive the solution to find the salary of the employee with the most inspections.",,

Here’s a breakdown of the thought process:  1. **Understand the Schema and Relationships:**    - Identify the relevant tables: `establishment`, `inspection`, and `violation`.    - Understand the relationships:      - `establishment` is linked to `inspection` via `license_no`.      - `inspection` is linked to `violation` via `inspection_id`.  2. **Identify Relevant Columns:**    - From `establishment`, we need `dba_name` (assumed name of the business).    - From `inspection`, we need `inspection_date` to filter the inspections for the year 2014.    - From `violation`, we need `fine` to calculate the total fines.  3. **Filter Inspections by Year:**    - We need to filter inspections that occurred in the year 2014. This can be done by extracting the year from the `inspection_date` column.  4. **Join Tables:**    - Join `establishment` and `inspection` on `license_no` to associate each inspection with a business.    - Join the result with `violation` on `inspection_id` to associate fines with each inspection.  5. **Aggregate Fines:**    - Use an aggregation function (SUM) to calculate the total fines for each business (`dba_name`) for the filtered inspections.  6. **Order and Limit Results:**    - Order the results by the total fines in descending order to identify the business with the highest fines.    - Use a LIMIT clause to get the top result, which is the business with the highest total fine.  7. **Write the SQL Query:**    - Construct the SQL query using the identified steps and operations:            SELECT T.dba_name       FROM (        SELECT T1.dba_name, SUM(T3.fine)         FROM establishment AS T1         INNER JOIN inspection AS T2 ON T1.license_no = T2.license_no         INNER JOIN violation AS T3 ON T2.inspection_id = T3.inspection_id         WHERE strftime('%Y', T2.inspection_date) = '2014'         GROUP BY T1.dba_name         ORDER BY SUM(T3.fine) DESC         LIMIT 1      ) AS T;        8. **Verify and Test:**    - Ensure the query logic aligns with the problem requirements.    - Test the query on sample data to verify it returns the expected result.  By following these logical steps, we can systematically approach the problem and construct a solution that accurately identifies the business with the highest total fine in 2014.",,

This involves extracting the year and month from the `inspection_date` column.  6. **Aggregate the Fines**:    - Once we have filtered the relevant inspections, we need to sum up the `fine` values from the `violation` table.  7. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Start by selecting the `fine` column from the `violation` table.    - Join the `violation` table with the `inspection` table using `inspection_id`.    - Join the `inspection` table with the `establishment` table using `license_no`.    - Apply the filters for `dba_name` and `inspection_date`.    - Use the `SUM` function to calculate the total fines.  8. **Write the SQL Query**:    - The final SQL query is:            SELECT SUM(T3.fine)       FROM establishment AS T1       INNER JOIN inspection AS T2 ON T1.license_no = T2.license_no       INNER JOIN violation AS T3 ON T2.inspection_id = T3.inspection_id       WHERE strftime('%Y-%m', T2.inspection_date) = '2014-02'       AND T1.dba_name = 'RON OF JAPAN INC'        By following these logical steps, we ensure that we accurately retrieve and aggregate the data needed to answer the problem statement.",,

Here's how you might approach the problem:  1. **Understand the Schema and Problem Requirements:**    - We have three relevant tables: `employee`, `inspection`, and `establishment`. However, only `employee` and `inspection` are necessary for this problem.    - The goal is to find the average number of inspections performed by the top 5 employees with the highest salary, specifically those with the title 'Sanitarian'.  2. **Identify Relevant Columns:**    - From the `employee` table, we need `employee_id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `salary`, and `title`.    - From the `inspection` table, we need `inspection_id` and `employee_id`.  3. **Filter Employees by Title:**    - Since we are interested in employees with the title 'Sanitarian', filter the `employee` table to include only those rows.  4. **Order Employees by Salary:**    - Order the filtered employees by the `salary` column in descending order to identify the top earners.  5. **Select Top 5 Employees:**    - Use the `LIMIT` clause to select the top 5 employees based on their salary.  6. **Join Tables to Count Inspections:**    - Perform an `INNER JOIN` between the `employee` table and the `inspection` table using the `employee_id` to associate each employee with their inspections.  7. **Count Distinct Inspections:**    - Use `COUNT(DISTINCT T2.inspection_id)` to count the number of unique inspections each of the top 5 employees has conducted.  8. **Calculate the Average:**    - Since we want the average number of inspections for the top 5 employees, divide the total count of inspections by 5.  9. **Select Required Columns:**    - Select the calculated average and the `first_name` and `last_name` of the top 5 employees to display their names alongside the average.  10. **Construct the SQL Query:**     - Combine all these steps into a single SQL query that performs the necessary filtering, ordering, joining, counting, and averaging.  By following these logical steps, you can construct the SQL query that answers the problem statement effectively. The final query is:   SELECT CAST(COUNT(DISTINCT T2.inspection_id) AS REAL) / 5, T1.first_name, T1.last_name  FROM employee AS T1  INNER JOIN inspection AS T2 ON T1.employee_id = T2.employee_id  WHERE T1.title = 'Sanitarian'  ORDER BY T1.salary DESC  LIMIT 5;   This query calculates the average number of inspections performed by the top 5 highest-paid employees with the title 'Sanitarian' and lists their names.",,

Here is a step-by-step logical approach to reach the solution:  1. **Understand the Schema and Relationships**:     - The `inspection` table contains inspection records with `results` indicating whether an inspection passed or failed.    - The `establishment` table contains business details, and the `license_no` column is the common key between `inspection` and `establishment`.  2. **Identify the Key Tables and Columns**:    - We need to focus on the `inspection` and `establishment` tables.    - Key columns: `inspection.results`, `inspection.license_no`, `establishment.dba_name`.  3. **Determine the Business with the Highest Number of Inspections**:    - We need to count the number of inspections for each business. This requires joining the `inspection` table with the `establishment` table on `license_no`.    - Use `GROUP BY` on `dba_name` to aggregate inspections per business.    - Use `COUNT(inspection_id)` to count the number of inspections for each business.  4. **Order and Limit the Results**:    - To find the business with the highest number of inspections, order the results in descending order of the inspection count.    - Use `LIMIT 1` to get the top result, which is the business with the highest number of inspections.  5. **Calculate the Percentage of Passed and Failed Inspections**:    - For the business identified in the previous step, calculate the percentage of inspections that passed and failed.    - Use `SUM(CASE WHEN results = 'Pass' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)` to count passed inspections.    - Use `SUM(CASE WHEN results = 'Fail' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)` to count failed inspections.    - Calculate the percentage by dividing the count of passed or failed inspections by the total number of inspections (`COUNT(inspection_id)`) and multiplying by 100.  6. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Use a `SELECT` statement to retrieve the `dba_name` and the calculated percentages.    - Use `INNER JOIN` to combine `inspection` and `establishment` based on `license_no`.    - Use `GROUP BY` to aggregate by `dba_name`.    - Use `ORDER BY COUNT(inspection_id) DESC` to sort by the number of inspections.    - Use `LIMIT 1` to get the business with the highest number of inspections.  By following these logical steps, we can construct the SQL query that solves the problem:   SELECT T2.dba_name,        CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN T1.results = 'Pass' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(T1.inspection_id) AS percentagePassed,        CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN T1.results = 'Fail' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(T1.inspection_id) AS percentageFailed FROM inspection AS T1 INNER JOIN establishment AS T2 ON T1.license_no = T2.license_no GROUP BY T2.dba_name ORDER BY COUNT(T1.inspection_id) DESC LIMIT 1;   This query will return the business with the highest number of inspections along with the percentage of inspections that passed and failed.",,

We are given a complete address, including the street, city, and state.  2. **Examine the Schema**: Review the schema to identify which table contains the relevant information. The `employee` table contains columns for `address`, `city`, `state`, and `last_name`, which are pertinent to the problem.  3. **Identify Relevant Columns**: From the `employee` table, identify the columns that will be used in the query:    - `address`: To match the specific street address.    - `city`: To ensure the city is ""Chicago"".    - `state`: To confirm the state is ""IL"".    - `last_name`: The column we need to retrieve.  4. **Formulate the Query**: Construct an SQL query that selects the `last_name` from the `employee` table where the `address`, `city`, and `state` match the given criteria.  5. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Use the `SELECT` statement to specify the column to retrieve (`last_name`).    - Use the `FROM` clause to specify the table (`employee`).    - Use the `WHERE` clause to filter records based on the given address, city, and state.  6. **Ensure Accuracy**: Double-check that the query correctly filters for the exact address, city, and state to avoid incorrect results.  7. **Solution**: The final SQL query is:        SELECT last_name FROM employee WHERE address = '7211 S Hermitage Ave' AND city = 'Chicago' AND state = 'IL';      By following these steps, we ensure that the query is logically structured to retrieve the correct employee's last name based on the provided address information.",,

Here's a breakdown of the thought process:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: We need to find the addresses of schools that passed inspections in March 2010. This involves filtering data based on specific conditions related to dates, results, and facility type.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - From the problem statement and schema, we identify that the `establishment` and `inspection` tables are relevant.    - We need the `address` from the `establishment` table.    - We need `inspection_date` and `results` from the `inspection` table.    - We also need to ensure that the `facility_type` in the `establishment` table is 'School'.  3. **Determine the Join Condition**:    - The `inspection` table can be linked to the `establishment` table using the `license_no` column, which is common in both tables. This will allow us to associate inspection results with specific establishments.  4. **Filter by Date**:    - We need inspections that occurred in March 2010. To extract the year and month from `inspection_date`, we can use a function like `strftime` in SQLite to format the date as 'YYYY-MM'. We then filter for '2010-03'.  5. **Filter by Results**:    - We only want establishments that passed the inspection, so we filter `results` to include only 'Pass'.  6. **Filter by Facility Type**:    - Since we are interested in schools, we add a condition to filter `facility_type` to 'School'.  7. **Select the Required Columns**:    - We need to select the `address` of the establishments that meet all the criteria.  8. **Ensure Unique Results**:    - Use `DISTINCT` to ensure that the addresses returned are unique, as there might be multiple inspections for the same establishment.  9. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Combine all the above steps into a SQL query:            SELECT DISTINCT T1.address      FROM establishment AS T1      INNER JOIN inspection AS T2 ON T1.license_no = T2.license_no      WHERE strftime('%Y-%m', T2.inspection_date) = '2010-03'        AND T2.results = 'Pass'        AND T1.facility_type = 'School'        By following these steps, we logically deduce the necessary components and conditions to create a query that addresses the problem statement effectively.",,

Identify the relevant tables and columns that might be useful for solving the problem. In this case, the `establishment` table contains the `dba_name` (doing business as name) of establishments, and the `inspection` table contains inspection details including `inspection_id`.  2. **Identify the Key Columns**: Determine which columns can be used to join the tables. The `establishment` table has a `license_no` column, which can be used to join with the `license_no` column in the `inspection` table.  3. **Formulate the Join**: Since we need to find inspection details for a specific establishment, we need to join the `establishment` and `inspection` tables using the `license_no` column. This will allow us to link each establishment with its corresponding inspections.  4. **Filter by Establishment Name**: Add a condition to filter the results for the establishment named ""PIZZA RUSTICA, INC."". This can be done by using a `WHERE` clause on the `dba_name` column in the `establishment` table.  5. **Select the Required Information**: Since the problem asks for the `inspection_id`, select this column from the joined tables. Use `DISTINCT` to ensure that each `inspection_id` is unique in the result set, in case there are multiple inspections for the same establishment.  6. **Write the SQL Query**: Combine all the above steps into a single SQL query:        SELECT DISTINCT T2.inspection_id    FROM establishment AS T1    INNER JOIN inspection AS T2 ON T1.license_no = T2.license_no    WHERE T1.dba_name = 'PIZZA RUSTICA, INC'      7. **Verify the Solution**: Ensure that the query correctly retrieves the `inspection_id` for ""PIZZA RUSTICA, INC."" by checking against any available data or test cases.

Here are the logical steps that could be taken to reach the solution:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to find the number of restaurants that have the highest risk level and have passed the inspection.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - From the schema, the relevant tables are `establishment` and `inspection`.    - In the `establishment` table, the columns of interest are `license_no`, `facility_type`, and `risk_level`.    - In the `inspection` table, the columns of interest are `license_no` and `results`.  3. **Determine the Highest Risk Level**:    - The problem states ""highest risk level,"" which implies we need to look for the maximum risk level value. From the sample data, we can see that risk levels are represented as integers, and the highest risk level in the samples is 3.  4. **Filter for Restaurants**:    - We are only interested in establishments that are restaurants. Therefore, we need to filter the `establishment` table where `facility_type` is 'Restaurant'.  5. **Filter for Highest Risk Level**:    - We need to further filter these restaurants to include only those with the highest risk level, which is 3.  6. **Join Tables on Common Key**:    - To determine if these restaurants passed the inspection, we need to join the `establishment` table with the `inspection` table on the common column `license_no`.  7. **Filter for Passed Inspections**:    - After joining, filter the results to include only those inspections where the `results` column is 'Pass'.  8. **Count Distinct Restaurants**:    - Finally, count the distinct `license_no` values from the filtered results to determine how many unique restaurants meet the criteria.  9. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Based on the above logic, the SQL query is formulated as follows:            SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT T1.license_no)      FROM establishment AS T1      INNER JOIN inspection AS T2 ON T1.license_no = T2.license_no      WHERE T1.risk_level = 3        AND T2.results = 'Pass'        AND T1.facility_type = 'Restaurant';        By following these logical steps, we can systematically approach the problem and arrive at the correct SQL query to solve it.",,

Here's how we can approach the problem:  1. **Understand the Schema and Relationships**:    - We have four tables: `employee`, `establishment`, `inspection`, `inspection_point`, and `violation`.    - The `employee` table contains employee details, including `employee_id`.    - The `inspection` table records inspections and links to employees through `employee_id` and establishments through `license_no`.    - The `violation` table records violations linked to inspections via `inspection_id` and to inspection points via `point_id`.    - The `inspection_point` table describes inspection points, including their `category`.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - We need to find employees (`employee` table) involved in inspections (`inspection` table) that have violations (`violation` table) related to a specific category in the `inspection_point` table.  3. **Determine the Necessary Joins**:    - To connect employees to the inspection points, we need to:      - Join `employee` and `inspection` on `employee_id`.      - Join `inspection` and `violation` on `inspection_id`.      - Join `violation` and `inspection_point` on `point_id`.  4. **Filter by Category**:    - We are interested in inspection points with the category ""Display of Inspection Report Summary"". This requires a `WHERE` clause to filter `inspection_point` records.  5. **Select and Distinct**:    - We need to select the employee names (`first_name` and `last_name`) and ensure they are distinct, as an employee might be involved in multiple inspections that meet the criteria.  6. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Using the above logic, construct the SQL query:        SELECT DISTINCT T1.first_name, T1.last_name    FROM employee AS T1    INNER JOIN inspection AS T2 ON T1.employee_id = T2.employee_id    INNER JOIN violation AS T3 ON T2.inspection_id = T3.inspection_id    INNER JOIN inspection_point AS T4 ON T3.point_id = T4.point_id    WHERE T4.category = 'Display of Inspection Report Summary'      7. **Verify and Test**:    - Ensure the query logic aligns with the problem requirements.    - Test the query with sample data to confirm it returns the expected results.  By following these steps, we systematically connect the necessary tables and filter the data to solve the problem effectively.",,

This relationship allows us to join these tables to get the required information.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - We need to join the `employee` and `inspection` tables on the `employee_id` column to link each inspection with the corresponding employee.    - We need to filter the results to only include the inspection with `inspection_id` 60332.    - Finally, we need to select the `title` of the employee from the `employee` table.  5. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Use an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `employee` and `inspection` tables based on the `employee_id`.    - Use a `WHERE` clause to filter for `inspection_id` 60332.    - Select the `title` from the `employee` table.  6. **Construct the Final Query**:        SELECT T1.title    FROM employee AS T1    INNER JOIN inspection AS T2 ON T1.employee_id = T2.employee_id    WHERE T2.inspection_id = 60332;      7. **Verify the Query**: Ensure that the query correctly retrieves the title of the employee associated with the specified inspection ID by checking the logic and relationships used in the query.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logical reasoning process:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to count the number of restaurants that have the lowest risk level and failed a complaint inspection.    - The key elements to focus on are: risk level, inspection type, and inspection results.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - From the schema, the relevant tables are `establishment` and `inspection`.    - In the `establishment` table, the columns of interest are `license_no`, `risk_level`, and `facility_type`.    - In the `inspection` table, the columns of interest are `license_no`, `inspection_type`, and `results`.  3. **Determine the Conditions**:    - We are interested in establishments with a risk level of '1' (lowest risk).    - The facility type should be 'Restaurant'.    - The inspection type should be 'Complaint'.    - The inspection result should be 'Fail'.  4. **Plan the SQL Query**:    - We need to join the `establishment` and `inspection` tables on the `license_no` column because this column is common to both tables and uniquely identifies each establishment.    - Apply the conditions identified in step 3 to filter the records.  5. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Use an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `establishment` and `inspection` tables based on `license_no`.    - Use a `WHERE` clause to apply the conditions: `risk_level = '1'`, `facility_type = 'Restaurant'`, `inspection_type = 'Complaint'`, and `results = 'Fail'`.    - Use `COUNT(DISTINCT T1.license_no)` to count the unique restaurants that meet all the criteria.  6. **Write the Final SQL Query**:        SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT T1.license_no)    FROM establishment AS T1    INNER JOIN inspection AS T2 ON T1.license_no = T2.license_no    WHERE T1.risk_level = '1'      AND T1.facility_type = 'Restaurant'      AND T2.inspection_type = 'Complaint'      AND T2.results = 'Fail';      7. **Verify the Query**:    - Ensure that the query correctly joins the tables and applies all the necessary filters.    - Check that the query counts distinct `license_no` values to avoid double-counting any restaurant.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logical reasoning process to arrive at the solution:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement:**    - We need to find the fine paid and the complete address of an establishment for a given inspection ID (48216).  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns:**    - Based on the schema provided, the relevant tables are `establishment`, `inspection`, and `violation`.    - The `establishment` table contains address details.    - The `inspection` table links inspection IDs to establishments through the `license_no`.    - The `violation` table contains information about fines associated with inspections.  3. **Determine the Relationships Between Tables:**    - The `inspection` table can be joined with the `establishment` table using the `license_no` column.    - The `inspection` table can also be joined with the `violation` table using the `inspection_id` column.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query:**    - Start by selecting the columns needed: `fine` from the `violation` table and `state`, `city`, `address` from the `establishment` table.    - Use `INNER JOIN` to connect the `establishment` and `inspection` tables on `license_no`.    - Use another `INNER JOIN` to connect the `inspection` and `violation` tables on `inspection_id`.    - Filter the results to only include the specified `inspection_id` (48216).  5. **Ensure Unique Results:**    - Use `DISTINCT` to ensure that the results are unique, as there might be multiple violations (and thus multiple fines) for a single inspection.  6. **Write the SQL Query:**    - Combine the above steps into a coherent SQL query:            SELECT DISTINCT T3.fine, T1.state, T1.city, T1.address      FROM establishment AS T1      INNER JOIN inspection AS T2 ON T1.license_no = T2.license_no      INNER JOIN violation AS T3 ON T2.inspection_id = T3.inspection_id      WHERE T2.inspection_id = 48216;        7. **Verify the Query:**    - Ensure that the query logically retrieves the correct information by considering the relationships and filtering criteria.  By following these logical steps, we can construct an SQL query that effectively retrieves the required information from the database.",,

Here are the logical steps that could have been taken to reach the solution:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: The task is to find an inspection ID where the inspection has a critical point level, a $500 fine, and an inspector comment of ""CDI ON 5-17-10"".  2. **Review the Schema**: Examine the tables and columns available in the schema to identify where the relevant information might be stored:    - The `inspection_point` table contains information about point levels and fines.    - The `violation` table contains information about fines and inspector comments.    - The `inspection` table contains inspection IDs, but it doesn't directly relate to the criteria given.  3. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - From the problem statement, we need to focus on the `inspection_point` and `violation` tables because they contain the necessary columns (`point_level`, `fine`, and `inspector_comment`).  4. **Determine the Relationship Between Tables**:    - The `violation` table has a `point_id` that corresponds to the `point_id` in the `inspection_point` table. This relationship allows us to join these tables.    - The `violation` table also has an `inspection_id`, which is the target of our query.  5. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Use an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `inspection_point` and `violation` tables on the `point_id` column, which is common to both tables.    - Apply the conditions specified in the problem:      - `T2.fine = 500`: Ensure the fine is $500.      - `T1.point_level = 'Critical'`: Ensure the point level is critical.      - `T2.inspector_comment = 'CDI ON 5-17-10'`: Ensure the inspector comment matches the given string.  6. **Select the Desired Output**:    - Select the `inspection_id` from the `violation` table (aliased as `T2` in the query) because this is the final output required.  7. **Write the Final Query**:    - The SQL query is constructed as follows:            SELECT T2.inspection_id      FROM inspection_point AS T1      INNER JOIN violation AS T2 ON T1.point_id = T2.point_id      WHERE T2.fine = 500      AND T1.point_level = 'Critical'      AND T2.inspector_comment = 'CDI ON 5-17-10';        By following these logical steps, we can systematically approach the problem and construct a query that retrieves the desired inspection ID based on the given criteria.",,

This will allow us to retrieve the description associated with each violation.    - Filter the results to only include records where the `inspection_id` matches the given ID (164795).  5. **Select the Required Columns**: From the joined tables, select the `Description` from the `inspection_point` table and the `inspector_comment` from the `violation` table.  6. **Write the SQL Query**:        SELECT T1.Description, T2.inspector_comment    FROM inspection_point AS T1    INNER JOIN violation AS T2 ON T1.point_id = T2.point_id    WHERE T2.inspection_id = 164795;      7. **Verify and Test the Query**: Ensure that the query correctly retrieves the desired information by testing it against the database. Check that the output matches the expected results for inspection ID 164795.  By following these logical steps, you can construct a SQL query that effectively retrieves the required inspection description and inspector's comments for a specific inspection ID.",,

Here's how we can approach the problem:  1. **Understand the Schema and Problem Statement:**    - We have multiple tables, but the relevant ones for this problem are `establishment` and `inspection`.    - We need to focus on establishments that failed their inspection (`inspection.results = 'Fail'`).    - We are interested in the risk level of these establishments, specifically those with the highest risk level (risk level 3).  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns:**    - From the `establishment` table, we need the `license_no` and `risk_level`.    - From the `inspection` table, we need the `license_no` and `results`.  3. **Determine the Relationship Between Tables:**    - The `establishment` and `inspection` tables are related through the `license_no` column, which serves as a foreign key.  4. **Formulate the Query:**    - We need to join the `establishment` and `inspection` tables on `license_no` to filter out the establishments that failed the inspection.    - Use an INNER JOIN to ensure we only consider records present in both tables.  5. **Filter for Failed Inspections:**    - Add a WHERE clause to filter the results where `inspection.results = 'Fail'`.  6. **Calculate the Percentage:**    - Count the total number of establishments that failed the inspection.    - Count the number of these establishments with a risk level of 3.    - Calculate the percentage by dividing the count of risk level 3 establishments by the total count of failed establishments and multiply by 100.  7. **Construct the SQL Query:**    - Use a CASE statement within the COUNT function to count only those establishments with a risk level of 3.    - Use the CAST function to ensure the division results in a real number for percentage calculation.  8. **Write the Final SQL Query:**        SELECT CAST(COUNT(CASE WHEN T1.risk_level = 3 THEN T1.license_no END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(T1.risk_level)    FROM establishment AS T1    INNER JOIN inspection AS T2 ON T1.license_no = T2.license_no    WHERE T2.results = 'Fail'      By following these logical steps, we ensure that we correctly identify and calculate the percentage of establishments with the highest risk level among those that failed their inspection.",,

Here are the logical steps to arrive at the solution:  1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to find the difference in counts of inspections resulting in fines of $100 and $500 for employees with salaries in the specified range.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**: The problem involves employees, inspections, and violations. Therefore, we need to work with the `employee`, `inspection`, and `violation` tables.  3. **Filter Employees by Salary**: Start by filtering the `employee` table to include only those employees whose salary is between $75,000 and $85,000.  4. **Join Tables**:    - **Join `employee` and `inspection`**: Use the `employee_id` to join these tables, as `inspection` records are linked to employees via this column.    - **Join `inspection` and `violation`**: Use the `inspection_id` to join these tables, since `violation` records are linked to inspections via this column.  5. **Filter Violations by Fine Amount**: We need to consider only those violations that resulted in fines of either $100 or $500.  6. **Calculate Counts for Each Fine**:    - Use a `CASE` statement to count the number of violations with a fine of $100.    - Use another `CASE` statement to count the number of violations with a fine of $500.  7. **Compute the Difference**: Subtract the count of $500 fines from the count of $100 fines to get the desired difference.  8. **Write the SQL Query**: Combine all the steps into a single SQL query:        SELECT         SUM(CASE WHEN T3.fine = 100 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) -         SUM(CASE WHEN T3.fine = 500 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)     FROM         employee AS T1     INNER JOIN         inspection AS T2 ON T1.employee_id = T2.employee_id     INNER JOIN         violation AS T3 ON T2.inspection_id = T3.inspection_id     WHERE         T1.salary BETWEEN 75000 AND 85000;      9. **Verify the Solution**: Ensure that the query correctly filters, joins, and calculates the required difference based on the problem statement and schema provided.  By following these steps, we systematically break down the problem and construct a solution that addresses the requirements using SQL.",,

The relevant data is likely stored in the `inspection` table, which contains details about each inspection, including the date it occurred.  2. **Identify Relevant Table and Columns**:     - The `inspection` table is the primary source of data for this query.    - The `inspection_date` column contains the date of each inspection, which is crucial for filtering the inspections that occurred in January 2011.    - The `inspection_id` column uniquely identifies each inspection and can be used to count the number of inspections.  3. **Determine the Date Filter**:    - We need to filter inspections to only include those that occurred in January 2011.    - The `inspection_date` column is in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`, so we need to extract the year and month to apply the filter.  4. **Use SQL Functions for Date Filtering**:    - The `strftime` function in SQL can be used to extract parts of a date. Specifically, `strftime('%Y-%m', inspection_date)` extracts the year and month in the format `YYYY-MM`.    - We can compare this extracted value to `'2011-01'` to filter for inspections that occurred in January 2011.  5. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Use the `SELECT COUNT(inspection_id)` statement to count the number of inspections.    - Apply the `WHERE` clause to filter the `inspection_date` using `strftime` to match `'2011-01'`.  6. **Write and Execute the Query**:    - The final SQL query is:            SELECT COUNT(inspection_id)       FROM inspection       WHERE strftime('%Y-%m', inspection_date) = '2011-01';          - This query will count all rows in the `inspection` table where the inspection date falls within January 2011.  By following these steps, we can efficiently determine the number of inspections conducted in January 2011 using the provided schema and SQL functions.",,

From the schema, it is implied that a fine of 100 is considered minor.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - The `violation` table is relevant because it contains information about fines related to inspections.    - Columns of interest in the `violation` table are `inspection_id` and `fine`.  3. **Determine the Condition for Minor Violations**:    - From the problem statement and schema, identify that a fine of 100 is considered a minor food safety problem.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - We need to calculate the percentage of inspections with a minor fine out of all inspections that have any violations.  5. **Calculate the Numerator**:    - Use a `CASE` statement within a `COUNT` function to count only those `inspection_id`s where the `fine` is 100. This gives us the number of inspections with a minor fine.  6. **Calculate the Denominator**:    - Use `COUNT(inspection_id)` to get the total number of inspections recorded in the `violation` table. This assumes that each entry in the `violation` table corresponds to an inspection with at least one violation.  7. **Calculate the Percentage**:    - Divide the count of inspections with a minor fine by the total count of inspections and multiply by 100 to convert it to a percentage.  8. **Ensure Correct Data Type for Calculation**:    - Use `CAST` to ensure that the division results in a real number rather than an integer, which is crucial for calculating percentages accurately.  9. **Construct the Final SQL Query**:    - Combine all the above logic into a single SQL query:            SELECT CAST(COUNT(CASE WHEN fine = 100 THEN inspection_id END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(inspection_id) FROM violation        10. **Verify and Validate**:     - Ensure that the query logically aligns with the problem statement and that it accurately calculates the desired percentage. Validate the results with sample data if possible.",,

This relationship allows us to join these tables to gather comprehensive information about violations associated with specific inspections.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - **Select Clause**: Decide what information needs to be retrieved. We need `point_id` and `fine` from the `violation` table.    - **From Clause**: Start with the `inspection` table as it contains the date information.    - **Join Clause**: Use an INNER JOIN to combine the `inspection` and `violation` tables on the `inspection_id` column. This ensures that we only get violations associated with the inspections on the specified date.    - **Where Clause**: Filter the results to include only those inspections that occurred on '2010-08-07'.  5. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Combine the above elements into a coherent SQL query:            SELECT T2.point_id, T2.fine       FROM inspection AS T1       INNER JOIN violation AS T2       ON T1.inspection_id = T2.inspection_id       WHERE T1.inspection_date = '2010-08-07';        6. **Verify the Query**:    - Ensure that the query logic aligns with the problem requirements.    - Check that the join condition correctly links the `inspection` and `violation` tables.    - Confirm that the date filter accurately targets the desired inspection date.

Here’s a breakdown of the thought process:  1. **Understand the Problem**:     - We need to count the number of inspections that involved violations under the ""Personnel"" category.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**:    - The `violation` table contains information about violations linked to specific inspections via `inspection_id`.    - The `inspection_point` table contains details about each inspection point, including the `category` of the inspection point.  3. **Determine the Relationship Between Tables**:    - The `violation` table has a `point_id` that corresponds to the `point_id` in the `inspection_point` table. This relationship allows us to link violations to their respective categories.  4. **Formulate the Query**:    - We need to join the `violation` table with the `inspection_point` table to access the `category` of each violation.    - Use an INNER JOIN on `point_id` to combine these tables, ensuring we only consider violations that have a corresponding inspection point.  5. **Filter by Category**:    - Once the tables are joined, apply a filter to select only those records where the `category` is ""Personnel"".  6. **Count the Inspections**:    - Use the `COUNT` function to determine the number of inspections that have violations in the ""Personnel"" category. Since each record in the `violation` table corresponds to an inspection, counting these records gives us the desired result.  7. **Write the SQL Query**:    - The SQL query is constructed as follows:            SELECT COUNT(T1.inspection_id)      FROM violation AS T1      INNER JOIN inspection_point AS T2 ON T1.point_id = T2.point_id      WHERE T2.category = 'Personnel'        By following these logical steps, we can systematically approach the problem and construct a query that accurately counts the number of inspections involving personnel-related violations.",,

The `inspection` table contains inspection results linked to these facilities via a `license_no`.  3. **Determine Necessary Columns**:     - From the `establishment` table, we need the `dba_name` (doing business as name) to identify the facility.    - From the `inspection` table, we need the `results` column to get the inspection outcomes.  4. **Establish Relationships Between Tables**:     - The `establishment` and `inspection` tables can be linked using the `license_no` column, which is present in both tables.  5. **Filter by City**: We need to filter the facilities that are located in Burnham. This can be done by applying a condition on the `city` column in the `establishment` table.  6. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Use an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `establishment` and `inspection` tables based on the `license_no` column. This will allow us to retrieve inspection results for each facility.    - Apply a `WHERE` clause to filter records where the `city` is 'BURNHAM'.    - Use `SELECT DISTINCT` to ensure that we only get unique combinations of facility names and inspection results, as a facility might have multiple inspections.  7. **Write the SQL Query**:    - The query should look like this:            SELECT DISTINCT T1.dba_name, T2.results      FROM establishment AS T1      INNER JOIN inspection AS T2 ON T1.license_no = T2.license_no      WHERE T1.city = 'BURNHAM'        8. **Verify the Query**: Ensure that the query correctly retrieves the desired information by checking it against the schema and sample data provided.

This requires a condition on the `inspection_date` column in the `inspection` table.    - We need to filter the results to only include inspections conducted by Sarah Lindsey.

This can be done using the `strftime` function to extract the year and month from the `inspection_date`.    - **Select Required Columns**: Select distinct categories and fines to avoid duplicate entries.  5. **Write the SQL Query**:    - The query should look like this:            SELECT DISTINCT T4.category, T3.fine      FROM inspection AS T1      INNER JOIN employee AS T2 ON T1.employee_id = T2.employee_id      INNER JOIN violation AS T3 ON T1.inspection_id = T3.inspection_id      INNER JOIN inspection_point AS T4 ON T3.point_id = T4.point_id      WHERE T2.first_name = 'Lisa'      AND T2.last_name = 'Tillman'      AND strftime('%Y-%m', T1.inspection_date) = '2014-01'        6. **Verify the Query**: Ensure that the query logic aligns with the problem requirements and that it correctly retrieves the desired information.

We need to count the number of inspections, so we focus on `inspection_id` from the `violation` table.    - Use an `INNER JOIN` to connect `inspection_point` and `violation` on `point_id` to filter violations by the specific category.  5. **Apply the Category Filter**:    - Add a `WHERE` clause to filter the results to only include those where the `category` is ""Display of Inspection Report Summary"".  6. **Count the Results**:    - Use the `COUNT()` function to count the number of distinct `inspection_id` entries that meet the criteria.  7. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Combine all the above steps into a coherent SQL query:            SELECT COUNT(T2.inspection_id)      FROM inspection_point AS T1      INNER JOIN violation AS T2 ON T1.point_id = T2.point_id      WHERE T1.category = 'Display of Inspection Report Summary';        By following these steps, you can logically derive the solution to the problem, ensuring that you correctly count the number of inspections related to the specified category.",,

This relationship allows us to join these tables to get the inspection details for a specific establishment.  5. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Use an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `establishment` and `inspection` tables based on the `license_no` column.    - Filter the results to only include rows where the `dba_name` in the `establishment` table is ""Riverwalk Café.""    - Select the `inspection_type` and `results` columns from the `inspection` table to get the desired output.  6. **Write the SQL Query**:    - The SQL query is formulated as follows:            SELECT T2.inspection_type, T2.results       FROM establishment AS T1       INNER JOIN inspection AS T2       ON T1.license_no = T2.license_no       WHERE T1.dba_name = 'Riverwalk Café';        7. **Verify the Solution**:    - Ensure that the query accurately retrieves the inspection types and results for ""Riverwalk Café"" by checking the logic and ensuring that the column names and conditions are correctly specified.  By following these logical steps, we can systematically approach and solve the SQL problem to retrieve the desired information about inspections conducted on Riverwalk Café.",,

Here's how you can approach this problem:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to calculate the total fines associated with violations under the ""Food Equipment and Utensil"" category.  2. **Examine the Schema**:    - Identify the relevant tables and columns. The `inspection_point` table contains the `category` and `fine` information, while the `violation` table contains the `point_id` and `fine` information.  3. **Identify the Relationship**:    - Determine how the tables are related. The `violation` table has a `point_id` that corresponds to the `point_id` in the `inspection_point` table. This relationship allows us to join these tables.  4. **Select the Relevant Data**:    - We need to focus on rows where the `category` in the `inspection_point` table is ""Food Equipment and Utensil"". This will filter out the relevant inspection points.  5. **Join the Tables**:    - Use an INNER JOIN to combine the `inspection_point` and `violation` tables based on the `point_id`. This will allow us to access the fine amounts for the relevant category.  6. **Aggregate the Data**:    - Use the SUM function to calculate the total fines from the `fine` column in the `violation` table for the specified category.  7. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Write the SQL query to implement the above logic:            SELECT SUM(T2.fine)      FROM inspection_point AS T1      INNER JOIN violation AS T2 ON T1.point_id = T2.point_id      WHERE T1.category = 'Food Equipment and Utensil'        8. **Validate the Solution**:    - Ensure that the query correctly calculates the total fines by checking against sample data or expected results.  By following these steps, you can logically arrive at the solution to calculate the total fines for the specified category.",,

This requires joining the `employee` table with the `inspection` table on `employee_id` and filtering where `first_name` is 'Jessica' and `last_name` is 'Anthony'.  4. **Filter the Date Range**:    - We are only interested in inspections between 2010 and 2017. This requires filtering the `inspection_date` to be within this range.  5. **Count the Inspections**:    - After filtering, count the number of inspections performed by Jessica Anthony in the specified date range.  6. **Calculate the Average**:    - The average inspections per year can be calculated by dividing the total number of inspections by the number of years (2010 to 2017 inclusive, which is 8 years).  7. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Use an SQL query to implement the above logic:      - Use `INNER JOIN` to combine `employee` and `inspection` tables on `employee_id`.      - Use `WHERE` clause to filter by `first_name`, `last_name`, and the year extracted from `inspection_date`.      - Use `COUNT` to count the number of inspections.      - Divide the count by 8 to get the average per year.  8. **Convert the Count to Real for Precision**:    - Ensure the result is in a real number format for precision by casting the count as `REAL`.  By following these steps, you can logically derive the SQL query to solve the problem. Here is the final query:   SELECT CAST(COUNT(CASE WHEN T1.first_name = 'Jessica' AND T1.last_name = 'Anthony' THEN T2.inspection_id ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) / 8  FROM employee AS T1  INNER JOIN inspection AS T2 ON T1.employee_id = T2.employee_id  WHERE strftime('%Y', T2.inspection_date) BETWEEN '2010' AND '2017';",,

We have an `employee` table and an `inspection` table. The `employee` table contains employee details, including phone numbers, while the `inspection` table contains inspection details, including the type of inspection and the employee who conducted it.  2. **Identify the Key Columns**:    - In the `employee` table, the key columns are `employee_id` and `phone`.    - In the `inspection` table, the key columns are `inspection_type` and `employee_id`.  3. **Determine the Relationship**:    - The `employee_id` column is common to both the `employee` and `inspection` tables, allowing us to join these tables.  4. **Filter the Data**:    - We need to filter the inspections to only include those of type ""Canvass"". This requires a condition on the `inspection_type` column in the `inspection` table.  5. **Join the Tables**:    - Use an INNER JOIN to combine the `employee` and `inspection` tables based on the `employee_id` column. This will allow us to associate each inspection with the corresponding employee.  6. **Select the Required Information**:    - From the joined tables, select the `phone` numbers from the `employee` table where the `inspection_type` is ""Canvass"".  7. **Ensure Uniqueness**:    - Use the DISTINCT keyword to ensure that each phone number is listed only once, even if an employee conducted multiple ""Canvass"" inspections.  8. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Combine all the above steps into a coherent SQL query:            SELECT DISTINCT T1.phone      FROM employee AS T1      INNER JOIN inspection AS T2 ON T1.employee_id = T2.employee_id      WHERE T2.inspection_type = 'Canvass';        By following these logical steps, we can effectively extract the desired information from the database.",,

We need the `results` from the `inspection` table.    - Use an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `establishment` and `inspection` tables on the `license_no` column to ensure we only get inspections related to the specific establishment.    - Add a `WHERE` clause to filter the results for the establishment with `dba_name` as ""Xando Coffee & Bar / Cosi Sandwich Bar.""  5. **Ensure Uniqueness**:    - Use `DISTINCT` to ensure that the results are unique, as there might be multiple inspections with the same result.  6. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Combine all these steps into the final SQL query:            SELECT DISTINCT T2.results      FROM establishment AS T1      INNER JOIN inspection AS T2 ON T1.license_no = T2.license_no      WHERE T1.dba_name = 'XANDO COFFEE & BAR / COSI SANDWICH BAR';        7. **Verify the Solution**:    - Double-check the query logic to ensure it accurately captures the requirements and correctly joins the tables.    - Consider edge cases, such as ensuring the `dba_name` is correctly matched and that the join condition is appropriate.  By following these logical steps, you can systematically arrive at the solution to the SQL problem.",,
