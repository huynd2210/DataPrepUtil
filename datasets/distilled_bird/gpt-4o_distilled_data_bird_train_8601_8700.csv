We need this to identify the community area numbers for Woodlawn and Lincoln Square.    - **Crime Table**: This table contains crime records, including the date of the crime and the community area number where the crime occurred. We need this to filter crimes by date and community area.  3. **Determine the Relationship Between Tables**:     - The `Crime` table has a `community_area_no` column that can be linked to the `community_area_no` column in the `Community_Area` table. This relationship allows us to join these tables and access community area names from the `Crime` records.  4. **Filter Data for Specific Community Areas**:    - Use the `Community_Area` table to filter records for 'Woodlawn' and 'Lincoln Square'. This can be done using a `WHERE` clause with `IN ('Woodlawn', 'Lincoln Square')`.  5. **Filter Data for Specific Time Period**:    - Use the `Crime` table to filter records for January 2018. This can be done by checking if the `date` column contains the substring '1/2018', which indicates the month and year.  6. **Join Tables**:    - Perform an `INNER JOIN` between the `Community_Area` and `Crime` tables on the `community_area_no` column to combine the relevant data.  7. **Aggregate and Count Crimes**:    - Group the results by `community_area_name` to count the number of crimes for each community area. Use the `GROUP BY` clause for this purpose.  8. **Order and Limit Results**:    - Order the results in descending order based on the count of crimes to determine which community area had more crimes. Use the `ORDER BY COUNT(...) DESC` clause.    - Limit the results to the top entry using `LIMIT 1` to get the community area with the highest crime count.  9. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Combine all the above steps into a coherent SQL query that retrieves the desired information.  By following these steps, we can construct the SQL query provided in the solution:   SELECT T1.community_area_name  FROM Community_Area AS T1  INNER JOIN Crime AS T2  ON T1.community_area_no = T2.community_area_no  WHERE T1.community_area_name IN ('Woodlawn', 'Lincoln Square')  AND T2.date LIKE '%1/2018%'  GROUP BY T1.community_area_name  ORDER BY COUNT(T1.community_area_name) DESC  LIMIT 1;",,

Here, the `Crime` table contains information about each crime, including the `district_no` where it occurred. The `District` table maps district numbers to district names.    - The goal is to calculate the percentage of crimes that occurred in the ""Central"" district.  2. **Identify the Necessary Data**:    - We need to determine the total number of crimes and the number of crimes that occurred specifically in the Central district.    - From the `Crime` table, we need the `case_number` to count total crimes.    - From the `District` table, we need the `district_name` to filter for crimes in the Central district.  3. **Join the Tables**:    - To associate each crime with its district name, perform an INNER JOIN between the `Crime` table and the `District` table on the `district_no` column. This allows us to access the `district_name` for each crime.  4. **Filter for Central District Crimes**:    - Use a CASE statement to create a conditional count. For each row, check if the `district_name` is ""Central"". If true, count it as 1; otherwise, count it as 0. This will help in calculating the number of crimes in the Central district.  5. **Calculate the Total Number of Crimes**:    - Use the COUNT function on the `case_number` from the `Crime` table to get the total number of crimes.  6. **Calculate the Percentage**:    - Divide the number of Central district crimes by the total number of crimes to get the fraction of crimes in the Central district.    - Multiply this fraction by 100 to convert it into a percentage.  7. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Combine the above logic into a single SQL query:            SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN T2.district_name = 'Central' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(T1.case_number)      FROM Crime AS T1      INNER JOIN District AS T2 ON T1.district_no = T2.district_no          - This query calculates the percentage of crimes occurring in the Central district by summing up the conditional counts for Central crimes and dividing by the total count of crimes.

This means we are interested in counting entries in the Community_Area table where the side is specified as ""Far North"".  2. **Identify Relevant Table and Columns**:    - From the schema provided, identify which table contains information about community areas and their respective sides. The `Community_Area` table is relevant here.    - Within the `Community_Area` table, the columns of interest are `community_area_no` (which uniquely identifies each community area) and `side` (which indicates the geographical side where the community area is located).  3. **Formulate the Query**:    - Since we need to count the number of community areas, we will use the SQL `COUNT()` function.    - We need to filter the rows where the `side` column is equal to ""Far North"". This can be done using a `WHERE` clause.  4. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - The SQL query should select the count of rows from the `Community_Area` table where the `side` is ""Far North"". The query would look like this:            SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Community_Area WHERE side = 'Far North'        5. **Verify the Query**:    - Ensure that the query correctly counts the number of community areas by checking if the `side` column is accurately filtered for ""Far North"".    - Consider edge cases, such as ensuring there are no typos in the side name and that the database is case-sensitive or not.  6. **Execute and Interpret the Results**:    - Run the query against the database to get the count of community areas in the Far North side.    - The result will be a single number representing the total count of community areas in that side.

The `Crime` table contains case numbers and district numbers, while the `District` table contains district numbers and district names.  3. **Determine the Relationship Between Tables**:     - The `Crime` table has a column `district_no` that can be used to link to the `District` table, which also has a `district_no` column. This establishes a relationship between these two tables.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - **Select the Desired Output**: We want to retrieve the `district_name` from the `District` table.    - **Join the Tables**: Use an `INNER JOIN` to connect the `Crime` table and the `District` table based on the `district_no` column. This allows us to combine information from both tables.    - **Filter for the Specific Case**: Use a `WHERE` clause to filter the records in the `Crime` table to only include the row where `case_number` is 'JB100065'.  5. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Start by selecting the `district_name` from the `District` table.    - Perform an `INNER JOIN` between `District` and `Crime` on the `district_no` column.    - Apply the `WHERE` clause to filter for `case_number = 'JB100065'`.  6. **Verify the Query**: Ensure that the query logic aligns with the schema and that it correctly retrieves the district name for the specified case number.

The `Crime` table includes latitude and longitude columns, which are relevant to our query.  3. **Locate Coordinates in the Table**: Determine which table contains the specific coordinates (41.66236555, -87.63470194). The `Crime` table has latitude and longitude columns, which suggests that this table should be queried to find the specific coordinates.  4. **Determine the Relationship Between Tables**: Understand how the `Crime` table is related to other tables. The `Crime` table has a `district_no` column, which can be used to join with the `District` table to obtain district-related information.  5. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - **Select the Desired Information**: We need the district name, which is in the `District` table.    - **Join the Tables**: Use an INNER JOIN between the `Crime` table and the `District` table on the `district_no` column to link crimes to their respective districts.    - **Filter by Coordinates**: Add a WHERE clause to filter the records in the `Crime` table by the given latitude and longitude.  6. **Write the SQL Query**:        SELECT T2.district_name    FROM Crime AS T1    INNER JOIN District AS T2 ON T1.district_no = T2.district_no    WHERE T1.longitude = '-87.63470194' AND T1.latitude = '41.66236555';      7. **Verify the Solution**: Ensure that the query correctly retrieves the district name by checking the relationships and data types in the schema to confirm that the join and filtering conditions are correctly applied.  By following these steps, you logically arrive at the solution to find the district name for the given coordinates.",,

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to find the name of the person responsible for a specific case number, JB524952. The term ""responsible"" in this context likely refers to the police commander in charge of the district where the case was reported.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**:    - From the schema provided, the `Crime` table contains a `case_number` column, which is directly relevant to the problem as it can be used to locate the specific case.    - The `District` table contains a `commander` column, which likely holds the name of the person responsible for cases in that district.  3. **Determine the Relationship Between Tables**:    - The `Crime` table has a `district_no` column, which can be used to join with the `district_no` column in the `District` table. This relationship allows us to link a specific crime to the district and, consequently, to the commander responsible for that district.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Start by selecting the `commander` from the `District` table, as this is the information we need.    - Use an `INNER JOIN` to connect the `District` table with the `Crime` table on the `district_no` column, ensuring that we only consider crimes within the correct district.    - Add a `WHERE` clause to filter the results to only include the specific case number, JB524952.  5. **Construct the Query**:    - The SQL query should look like this:            SELECT T1.commander       FROM District AS T1       INNER JOIN Crime AS T2       ON T1.district_no = T2.district_no       WHERE T2.case_number = 'JB524952';          - This query selects the `commander` from the `District` table (`T1`), joins it with the `Crime` table (`T2`) using the `district_no`, and filters the results to the specific case number JB524952.  By following these logical steps, we can effectively construct a query that retrieves the name of the person responsible for the specified case.",,

Here are the logical steps that could have been taken:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to find the number of simple assaults that occurred on a specific date, 2018/9/8.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - From the schema, the `Crime` table contains information about each crime, including the date (`date` column) and the type of crime (`iucr_no` column).    - The `IUCR` table provides descriptions for each `iucr_no`, including `primary_description` and `secondary_description`.  3. **Determine the Relationship Between Tables**:    - The `Crime` table can be joined with the `IUCR` table using the `iucr_no` column, as both tables share this column.  4. **Filter for the Specific Date**:    - We need to filter the `Crime` table to only include records from 2018/9/8. This can be done using a `WHERE` clause with a `LIKE` condition to match the date format.  5. **Identify the Type of Crime**:    - We are interested in assaults, specifically simple assaults. In the `IUCR` table, the `primary_description` column should be 'ASSAULT', and the `secondary_description` should be 'SIMPLE'.  6. **Count the Number of Simple Assaults**:    - Use a `CASE` statement within a `SUM` function to count the number of occurrences where the `secondary_description` is 'SIMPLE'. This will add 1 for each simple assault and 0 otherwise.  7. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Combine the above steps into a SQL query:            SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN T2.secondary_description = 'SIMPLE' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)      FROM Crime AS T1      INNER JOIN IUCR AS T2 ON T1.iucr_no = T2.iucr_no      WHERE T1.date LIKE '%9/8/2018%' AND T2.primary_description = 'ASSAULT'        8. **Validate the Solution**:    - Ensure the query logic aligns with the problem requirements and that the correct tables and columns are used. Check the query against sample data if available.  By following these steps, we systematically break down the problem and construct a solution that accurately counts the number of simple assaults on the specified date.",,

This requires counting the number of such incidents for each district and identifying the district with the maximum count.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - The `IUCR` table contains crime descriptions, including the type of homicide.    - The `Crime` table records individual crime incidents, including the district number and the IUCR code that links to the type of crime.  3. **Determine the Specific Crime Type**:    - From the `IUCR` table, identify the `iucr_no` associated with ""FIRST DEGREE MURDER"" in the `secondary_description` column. This is crucial for filtering the relevant crime records.  4. **Join Tables to Link Crime Incidents to Descriptions**:    - Perform an inner join between the `IUCR` table and the `Crime` table on the `iucr_no` column. This allows us to filter crime incidents based on the specific type of crime (first-degree murder).  5. **Filter for First Degree Murder**:    - Use a `WHERE` clause to filter the joined data for records where the `secondary_description` in the `IUCR` table is ""FIRST DEGREE MURDER"".  6. **Group and Count Incidents by District**:    - Group the filtered results by `district_no` from the `Crime` table. This will allow us to count the number of first-degree murder incidents per district.  7. **Order by Count and Select the Top Result**:    - Use `ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC` to sort the districts by the number of incidents in descending order.    - Use `LIMIT 1` to select the district with the highest count, which is the district with the most first-degree murders.  8. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Combine all these steps into a coherent SQL query:            SELECT T2.district_no      FROM IUCR AS T1      INNER JOIN Crime AS T2 ON T1.iucr_no = T2.iucr_no      WHERE T1.secondary_description = 'FIRST DEGREE MURDER'      GROUP BY T2.district_no      ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC      LIMIT 1        By following these steps, you can logically arrive at the solution to the problem.",,

The severity is indicated by an index code, which is associated with the IUCR number in the IUCR table.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**: From the schema provided, we need to focus on the tables that can help us link the case number to its severity index code. The relevant tables are:    - `Crime`: This table contains the `case_number` and `iucr_no`.    - `IUCR`: This table contains the `iucr_no` and the `index_code`, which indicates the severity.  3. **Determine the Relationship Between Tables**:     - The `Crime` table has a column `iucr_no` that can be used to join with the `IUCR` table, which also has the `iucr_no` column. This relationship allows us to map each crime to its corresponding IUCR details, including the severity index code.  4. **Formulate the Query**:    - Start by selecting the `iucr_no` from the `Crime` table where the `case_number` is 'JB296775'. This will help us identify which IUCR entry corresponds to the case.    - Use an `INNER JOIN` between the `Crime` table and the `IUCR` table on the `iucr_no` to access the `index_code` for the identified IUCR number.  5. **Write the SQL Query**:    - The SQL query is constructed to join the `Crime` and `IUCR` tables and filter the results to the specific case number 'JB296775'. The query will return the `iucr_no`, which can be used to look up the `index_code` in the `IUCR` table.  6. **Execute and Interpret the Query**:    - Execute the query to retrieve the `iucr_no` for the case 'JB296775'. This IUCR number is then used to find the corresponding `index_code` in the `IUCR` table, which indicates the severity of the case.  By following these steps, we can effectively determine the severity of the case JB296775 by identifying the appropriate index code associated with its IUCR number.",,

This involves identifying thefts specifically categorized as pocket-picking.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - The `Crime` table contains records of crimes, including the `iucr_no` which links to the `IUCR` table for crime descriptions.    - The `IUCR` table provides detailed descriptions of crimes, including primary and secondary descriptions.    - The `Community_Area` table contains community area numbers and their corresponding names.  3. **Establish Table Relationships**:    - Use the `iucr_no` to join the `Crime` table with the `IUCR` table to filter crimes by their descriptions.    - Use the `community_area_no` to join the `Crime` table with the `Community_Area` table to retrieve the community area names.  4. **Filter for Specific Crime Type**:    - In the `IUCR` table, filter records where `primary_description` is 'THEFT' and `secondary_description` is 'POCKET-PICKING'. This narrows down the crimes to only those of interest.  5. **Aggregate and Sort Data**:    - Group the filtered crime records by `community_area_no` to count the number of pocket-picking incidents in each community area.    - Order the results by the count of incidents in descending order to identify the community area with the highest number of such incidents.  6. **Retrieve the Desired Information**:    - Select the `community_area_name` from the `Community_Area` table corresponding to the community area number with the most pocket-picking thefts.    - Use `LIMIT 1` to ensure only the top result is returned, which represents the community area with the highest number of pocket-picking incidents.  7. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Write the SQL query using the above logic, ensuring proper joins, filtering, grouping, ordering, and selection of the required fields.  By following these steps, we can construct the SQL query that effectively answers the problem statement. The final query is:   SELECT T3.community_area_name  FROM IUCR AS T1  INNER JOIN Crime AS T2 ON T1.iucr_no = T2.iucr_no  INNER JOIN Community_Area AS T3 ON T2.community_area_no = T3.community_area_no  WHERE T1.primary_description = 'THEFT'  AND T1.secondary_description = 'POCKET-PICKING'  GROUP BY T2.community_area_no  ORDER BY COUNT(T2.case_number) DESC  LIMIT 1;   This query will return the name of the community area with the most pocket-picking thefts.",,

Here is the SQL query that implements these steps:   SELECT T1.alderman_first_name, T1.alderman_last_name FROM Ward AS T1 INNER JOIN Crime AS T2 ON T1.ward_no = T2.ward_no WHERE T2.case_number = 'JB103470';   By following these logical steps, we ensure that we accurately identify the alderman associated with the legislative district where the specified crime case occurred.",,

The `Community_Area` table contains community area names, and the `Neighborhood` table contains neighborhood names and their associated community area numbers.  3. **Determine the Relationship**: Recognize that the `Neighborhood` table has a foreign key (`community_area_no`) that links to the `Community_Area` table's primary key (`community_area_no`). This relationship allows us to associate neighborhoods with their respective community areas.  4. **Filter by Community Area Name**: Since we are interested in the Roseland community, we need to filter the `Community_Area` table to include only rows where `community_area_name` is 'Roseland'.  5. **Join Tables**: Perform an inner join between the `Community_Area` and `Neighborhood` tables on the `community_area_no` column to get neighborhoods associated with Roseland.  6. **Count Distinct Neighborhoods**: Use an aggregate function to count the number of distinct neighborhoods. Since the problem asks for the number of different neighborhoods, we need to ensure we count unique neighborhood names.  7. **Formulate the SQL Query**: Based on the above steps, write the SQL query to achieve the desired result. The query should join the tables, filter for Roseland, and count the distinct neighborhoods.  8. **Review the Solution**: Ensure the SQL query logically follows the steps and correctly implements the solution.  The final SQL query is:  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT T2.neighborhood_name) FROM Community_Area AS T1 INNER JOIN Neighborhood AS T2 ON T1.community_area_no = T2.community_area_no WHERE T1.community_area_name = 'Roseland';   This query counts the distinct neighborhood names in the Roseland community area by joining the relevant tables and applying the necessary filters.",,

This will allow us to retrieve the description of the FBI code associated with the case.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Start by selecting the `description` from the `FBI_Code` table since that is the information we need.    - Use an `INNER JOIN` to connect the `Crime` table with the `FBI_Code` table on the `fbi_code_no` column.    - Add a `WHERE` clause to filter the records to only those where the `case_number` in the `Crime` table is 'JB134191'.  5. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - The SQL query is constructed as follows:            SELECT description      FROM Crime AS T1      INNER JOIN FBI_Code AS T2 ON T1.fbi_code_no = T2.fbi_code_no      WHERE T1.case_number = 'JB134191'          - This query selects the `description` from the `FBI_Code` table for the specific case number by joining the two tables on the `fbi_code_no`.  6. **Verify the Solution**:    - Ensure that the query correctly retrieves the description for the specified case number by checking the logic and the join condition.  By following these steps, we logically deduce the necessary SQL query to solve the problem.",,

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the logical reasoning process to arrive at the solution:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement:**    - We need to count the number of crime cases where an arrest was made in the North Lawndale community.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns:**    - From the schema, identify the tables and columns that contain the necessary information:      - `Community_Area` table: Contains `community_area_name` and `community_area_no`.      - `Crime` table: Contains `community_area_no` and `arrest`.  3. **Determine the Relationship Between Tables:**    - The `Community_Area` and `Crime` tables can be joined using the `community_area_no` column, as it is common to both tables.  4. **Filter for the Specific Community:**    - We are interested in the North Lawndale community. Therefore, filter the records in the `Community_Area` table where `community_area_name` is 'North Lawndale'.  5. **Filter for Arrest Cases:**    - In the `Crime` table, filter the records where the `arrest` column is 'TRUE', indicating that an arrest was made.  6. **Join the Tables:**    - Perform an INNER JOIN between the `Community_Area` and `Crime` tables on the `community_area_no` column to combine the relevant data.  7. **Count the Number of Arrest Cases:**    - Use a conditional aggregation to count the number of cases where the `community_area_name` is 'North Lawndale' and an arrest was made. This can be done using a `SUM` function with a `CASE` statement.  8. **Construct the SQL Query:**    - Combine all the above steps into a single SQL query:            SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN T1.community_area_name = 'North Lawndale' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)      FROM Community_Area AS T1      INNER JOIN Crime AS T2 ON T1.community_area_no = T2.community_area_no      WHERE T2.arrest = 'TRUE'        By following these logical steps, we ensure that the query accurately counts the number of arrest cases in the North Lawndale community.",,

Here's how we can break down the process:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: We need to calculate the percentage of thefts that are under $500 in the West Englewood community area. This involves filtering cases based on specific criteria and performing calculations.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - **Crime Table**: Contains information about each crime case, including the `community_area_no`, `iucr_no`, and `case_number`.    - **IUCR Table**: Provides details about the type of crime, including `primary_description` and `secondary_description`.    - **Community_Area Table**: Maps `community_area_no` to `community_area_name`, allowing us to filter cases by the West Englewood area.  3. **Determine Necessary Joins**:    - Join the **Crime** table with the **IUCR** table on `iucr_no` to access crime descriptions.    - Join the **Crime** table with the **Community_Area** table on `community_area_no` to filter by the West Englewood area.  4. **Filter the Data**:    - Use the `Community_Area` table to filter cases that occurred in West Englewood by checking `community_area_name = 'West Englewood'`.    - Use the `IUCR` table to filter cases where the `primary_description` is 'THEFT'.  5. **Calculate the Percentage**:    - Use a `CASE` statement to count the number of theft cases with `secondary_description = '$500 AND UNDER'`.    - Calculate the total number of theft cases in West Englewood by counting the `case_number`.    - Compute the percentage by dividing the count of under $500 thefts by the total theft cases and multiplying by 100.  6. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Construct the SQL query using `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables and `WHERE` clauses to apply the necessary filters.    - Use `SUM` with a `CASE` statement to count the under $500 thefts and `COUNT` to get the total number of theft cases.    - Use `CAST` to ensure the division results in a real number for percentage calculation.  By following these steps, we can logically derive the SQL query that solves the problem. The final query is:   SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN T2.secondary_description = '$500 AND UNDER' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(T1.case_number) FROM Crime AS T1 INNER JOIN IUCR AS T2 ON T1.iucr_no = T2.iucr_no INNER JOIN Community_Area AS T3 ON T1.community_area_no = T3.community_area_no WHERE T2.primary_description = 'THEFT' AND T3.community_area_name = 'West Englewood'   This query calculates the desired percentage by leveraging the relationships between the tables and applying the necessary filters and calculations.",,

Here's how we can break down the process:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: We need to calculate the percentage of larceny cases in the Edgewater community. This requires us to identify all crime cases in Edgewater and determine how many of those are larceny cases.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:     - We need the `Community_Area` table to identify the community area number for Edgewater.    - The `Crime` table is necessary to get crime cases associated with the Edgewater community.    - The `FBI_Code` table will help us identify which crimes are classified as larceny.  3. **Determine the Relationships Between Tables**:     - The `Community_Area` table can be joined with the `Crime` table using the `community_area_no` column to filter crimes that occurred in Edgewater.    - The `Crime` table can be joined with the `FBI_Code` table using the `fbi_code_no` column to determine the type of crime.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - **Join Tables**: Start by joining the `Community_Area` table with the `Crime` table on `community_area_no` to get all crimes in Edgewater. Then, join the result with the `FBI_Code` table on `fbi_code_no` to get the crime type.    - **Filter for Edgewater**: Use a `WHERE` clause to filter the results to only include crimes that occurred in the Edgewater community.    - **Calculate Larceny Cases**: Use a `CASE` statement to count the number of larceny cases. This involves checking if the `title` from the `FBI_Code` table is 'Larceny'.    - **Calculate Total Cases**: Use `COUNT` to get the total number of cases in Edgewater.    - **Calculate Percentage**: Divide the number of larceny cases by the total number of cases and multiply by 100 to get the percentage.  5. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Use `SUM` with a `CASE` statement to count larceny cases.    - Use `COUNT` to get the total number of cases.    - Cast the result of the division to `REAL` to ensure the percentage is calculated correctly.  6. **Final Query**:        SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN T3.title = 'Larceny' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(T2.case_number)    FROM Community_Area AS T1    INNER JOIN Crime AS T2 ON T1.community_area_no = T2.community_area_no    INNER JOIN FBI_Code AS T3 ON T2.fbi_code_no = T3.fbi_code_no    WHERE T1.community_area_name = 'Edgewater'      By following these steps, we ensure that we accurately calculate the percentage of larceny cases in the Edgewater community using the given database schema.",,

The pattern `'5/%/2018%'` will match any date in May 2018.  6. **Count the Number of Crimes**:    - Use a `SUM` function with a `CASE` statement to count the number of records that meet the criteria.    - The `CASE` statement will return 1 for each record that matches the date pattern, and 0 otherwise. The `SUM` function will then add up these values to give the total count.  7. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Combine the above logic into a single SQL query:            SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN date LIKE '5/%/2018%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)       FROM Crime       WHERE block = '018XX S KOMENSKY AVE';        8. **Verify the Solution**:    - Ensure the query correctly counts the number of crimes by testing it against the database, if possible, or by logical reasoning and checking the syntax and logic.  By following these logical steps, we can systematically arrive at the solution to count the number of crimes committed at the specified address in May 2018.",,

This can be achieved by filtering the `date` column to include only entries from the year 2018. We can use a pattern match to check if the date contains ""2018"".  4. **Filter by Location**: We are interested in incidents that occurred specifically in an ""ABANDONED BUILDING"". Therefore, we need to filter the `location_description` column to include only those entries.  5. **Filter by Domestic Violence**: We need to ensure that the incidents are marked as domestic violence. This can be done by filtering the `domestic` column to include only entries where the value is 'TRUE'.  6. **Count the Incidents**: After applying the necessary filters, we need to count the number of incidents that meet all the criteria. This can be achieved using a conditional aggregation (e.g., using a `CASE` statement within a `SUM` function) to count each qualifying incident.  7. **Write the SQL Query**: Based on the above steps, the SQL query can be constructed as follows:        SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN location_description = 'ABANDONED BUILDING' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)     FROM Crime     WHERE date LIKE '%2018%' AND domestic = 'TRUE'      8. **Verify the Solution**: Ensure that the query correctly captures all incidents that match the criteria and returns the correct count.  By following these steps, we can systematically approach the problem and construct a query that accurately counts the number of domestic violence incidents in abandoned buildings in 2018.",,

Here are the logical steps that could have been taken to reach the solution:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: The task is to find the population of the district with the least population. This requires identifying the district with the smallest total population.  2. **Analyze the Schema**: Review the schema to identify which tables and columns are relevant to solving the problem. The `Community_Area` table contains a `population` column, which is crucial for calculating population totals. The `District` table does not directly contain population data, so we need to determine how districts relate to community areas.  3. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:     - The `Community_Area` table has a `population` column, which indicates the population of each community area.    - The `District` table does not have a direct population column, so we need to consider how community areas might be grouped into districts.  4. **Determine Grouping Criteria**: Since the problem asks for the population of a district, we need to determine how community areas are grouped into districts. The schema does not provide a direct relationship between community areas and districts, but it does provide a `side` column in the `Community_Area` table. This suggests grouping by `side` might be relevant.  5. **Calculate Population by Group**:     - Use the `SUM(population)` function to calculate the total population for each group. Since there is no direct district grouping, we assume the grouping is by `side` as a proxy for districts.    - Use `GROUP BY side` to aggregate the population totals for each side.  6. **Order and Limit Results**:     - Use `ORDER BY SUM(population)` to sort the aggregated results by total population in ascending order.    - Use `LIMIT 1` to select the group with the smallest total population.  7. **Formulate the SQL Query**: Based on the above steps, the SQL query is constructed as follows:        SELECT SUM(population)     FROM Community_Area     GROUP BY side     ORDER BY SUM(population)     LIMIT 1;      8. **Verify Assumptions**: Ensure that the assumption of using `side` as a proxy for districts is valid based on the schema and problem context. If additional information were available, such as a direct mapping between community areas and districts, the query might need adjustment.  By following these logical steps, we arrive at the solution that calculates the population of the district (or group, in this case, `side`) with the least population.",,

This can be done using a `LIKE` condition with the string '%2018%'.    - **Location Description:** We need to filter the `location_description` column to include only entries where the location is 'ANIMAL HOSPITAL'.    - **FBI Code:** We need to filter the `fbi_code_no` column to include only entries with the code '08B'.  4. **Count Arrests:**    - We need to count the number of arrests. The `arrest` column indicates whether an arrest was made (with 'TRUE' or 'FALSE').    - Use a `CASE` statement to count only those entries where `arrest` is 'TRUE'. This can be done by summing up the results of the `CASE` statement.  5. **Formulate the SQL Query:**    - Combine all the above conditions and logic into a single SQL query.    - Use `SUM(CASE WHEN arrest = 'TRUE' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)` to count the number of arrests.    - Apply the `WHERE` clause to filter the data based on the year, location, and FBI code.  6. **Write the Final SQL Query:**    - The final SQL query is:            SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN arrest = 'TRUE' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)       FROM Crime       WHERE date LIKE '%2018%'         AND location_description = 'ANIMAL HOSPITAL'         AND fbi_code_no = '08B';        By following these steps, we ensure that we accurately filter and count the relevant data to answer the problem statement.",,

This involves identifying the district with the most such incidents and then retrieving the commanding officer's information.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - From the schema, the relevant tables are `District`, `Crime`, and `FBI_Code`.    - `District` contains the commanding officer information.    - `Crime` contains records of incidents, including the district number.    - `FBI_Code` contains the title of the crime, which we need to filter for ""Disorderly Conduct"".  3. **Determine Necessary Joins**:    - Join `District` and `Crime` on `district_no` to associate each crime with its district.    - Join `Crime` and `FBI_Code` on `fbi_code_no` to identify the type of crime.  4. **Filter for Disorderly Conduct**:    - Use the `FBI_Code` table to filter crimes with the title ""Disorderly Conduct"". We assume the `fbi_code_no` for ""Disorderly Conduct"" is known (e.g., 24).  5. **Aggregate and Count Incidents**:    - Group the results by `district_no` and count the number of disorderly conduct incidents per district.  6. **Identify the District with the Most Incidents**:    - Order the results by the count of incidents in descending order to find the district with the highest number of incidents.  7. **Retrieve the Commanding Officer**:    - Select the commanding officer from the `District` table for the district with the highest count of disorderly conduct incidents.  8. **Limit the Result**:    - Use `LIMIT 1` to ensure only the top result (district with the highest number of incidents) is returned.  By following these steps, you can construct the SQL query that efficiently retrieves the desired information. The solution query is:   SELECT T1.commander FROM District AS T1 INNER JOIN Crime AS T2 ON T1.district_no = T2.district_no INNER JOIN FBI_Code AS T3 ON T2.fbi_code_no = T3.fbi_code_no WHERE T3.title = 'Disorderly Conduct' AND T2.fbi_code_no = 24 GROUP BY T2.district_no ORDER BY COUNT(T1.district_no) DESC LIMIT 1;   This query correctly identifies the commanding officer of the district with the highest number of disorderly conduct incidents.",,

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process:  1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to determine which crime has the highest frequency of occurrence based on the available data. The focus is on the crime committed most frequently by criminals.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - The `Crime` table contains records of crimes, including the `fbi_code_no` which links to the type of crime.    - The `FBI_Code` table contains details about each crime type, including the `title` which describes the crime.  3. **Determine the Relationship**:    - The `Crime` table and the `FBI_Code` table are related through the `fbi_code_no` column. This relationship allows us to map each crime record to its corresponding crime type.  4. **Formulate the Query**:    - We need to count the occurrences of each crime type. This can be done by grouping the records in the `Crime` table by `fbi_code_no` and counting the number of occurrences for each group.  5. **Sort and Select the Most Frequent Crime**:    - After counting the occurrences, we need to sort the results in descending order to identify the crime with the highest count.    - The `LIMIT 1` clause will help us select only the top result, which is the most frequently committed crime.  6. **Retrieve the Crime Title**:    - Once we identify the most frequent `fbi_code_no`, we need to retrieve the corresponding `title` from the `FBI_Code` table to get the human-readable name of the crime.  7. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Using the above logic, we construct the SQL query to join the `Crime` and `FBI_Code` tables, count the occurrences of each crime type, sort them, and select the top result.  Here's the final SQL query based on the above reasoning:   SELECT T2.title FROM Crime AS T1 INNER JOIN FBI_Code AS T2 ON T1.fbi_code_no = T2.fbi_code_no GROUP BY T1.fbi_code_no ORDER BY COUNT(T1.fbi_code_no) DESC LIMIT 1;   This query will give us the title of the crime that was committed the most by criminals, based on the data in the `Crime` and `FBI_Code` tables.",,

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the logical reasoning process:  1. **Understand the Problem Requirements**:     - We need to find the number of arrests in Albany Park.    - The arrests should be for the crime of ""Criminal Sexual Abuse"".    - The location of the crime should be an ""APARTMENT"".  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - **Crime Table**: This table contains information about each crime, including the location, arrest status, and the IUCR number which can be linked to specific crime types.      - Relevant columns: `district_no`, `location_description`, `arrest`, `fbi_code_no`.    - **District Table**: This table contains information about different districts, including their names.      - Relevant columns: `district_no`, `district_name`.    - **FBI_Code Table**: This table provides the titles of crimes corresponding to FBI codes.      - Relevant columns: `fbi_code_no`, `title`.  3. **Determine the Relationships**:    - The `Crime` table can be linked to the `District` table using the `district_no` column.    - The `Crime` table can be linked to the `FBI_Code` table using the `fbi_code_no` column.  4. **Formulate the Query**:    - **Join Tables**: Use INNER JOIN to combine the `Crime`, `District`, and `FBI_Code` tables based on their relationships.      - Join `Crime` and `District` on `district_no`.      - Join `Crime` and `FBI_Code` on `fbi_code_no`.    - **Filter Conditions**: Apply filters to meet the problem requirements.      - Filter for crimes in ""Albany Park"" using `district_name`.      - Filter for crimes where an arrest was made using `arrest = 'TRUE'`.      - Filter for crimes that occurred in an ""APARTMENT"" using `location_description`.      - Filter for crimes with the title ""Criminal Sexual Abuse"" using the `title` column from the `FBI_Code` table.    - **Count the Arrests**: Use a conditional aggregation to count the number of relevant arrests.      - Use `SUM(CASE WHEN T3.title = 'Criminal Sexual Abuse' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)` to count the number of cases that meet all conditions.  5. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Combine all the above steps into a coherent SQL query:            SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN T3.title = 'Criminal Sexual Abuse' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)      FROM District AS T1      INNER JOIN Crime AS T2 ON T1.district_no = T2.district_no      INNER JOIN FBI_Code AS T3 ON T2.fbi_code_no = T3.fbi_code_no      WHERE T1.district_name = 'Albany Park'      AND T2.arrest = 'TRUE'      AND T2.location_description = 'APARTMENT';        By following these logical steps, we ensure that the query accurately retrieves the desired information from the database.",,

Here are the steps:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: We need to find the location where most robberies occurred in Rogers Park. This requires us to focus on the `Crime` table for incidents and the `Community_Area` table to filter by the specific community area.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - **Community_Area Table**: We need this table to filter crimes that occurred in the Rogers Park area. The relevant columns are `community_area_no` and `community_area_name`.    - **Crime Table**: This table contains details about each crime, including the location coordinates (`latitude` and `longitude`), the type of crime (`iucr_no`), and the community area (`community_area_no`).    - **FBI_Code Table**: This table helps us identify the type of crime by linking `iucr_no` from the `Crime` table to the `title` of the crime, which in this case is 'Robbery'.  3. **Determine the Necessary Joins**:    - **Join Community_Area and Crime**: We need to join these tables on `community_area_no` to filter crimes that occurred in Rogers Park.    - **Join Crime and FBI_Code**: We join these tables on `fbi_code_no` to filter crimes specifically categorized as 'Robbery'.  4. **Filter Conditions**:    - **Community Area**: Filter the results where `community_area_name` is 'Rogers Park'.    - **Crime Type**: Filter the results where the `title` in the `FBI_Code` table is 'Robbery'.  5. **Select Required Columns**:    - We need to select the `latitude` and `longitude` from the `Crime` table to identify the precise location of the robberies.  6. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Using the identified tables, joins, and filters, construct the SQL query to extract the required data:            SELECT T2.latitude, T2.longitude       FROM Community_Area AS T1       INNER JOIN Crime AS T2 ON T1.community_area_no = T2.community_area_no       INNER JOIN FBI_Code AS T3 ON T2.fbi_code_no = T3.fbi_code_no       WHERE T1.community_area_name = 'Rogers Park'       AND T3.title = 'Robbery';        7. **Analyze the Results**:    - Once the query is executed, analyze the results to determine the most frequent location (latitude and longitude) where robberies occurred in Rogers Park. This might involve additional steps such as grouping by coordinates and counting occurrences if the query result is not directly aggregated.  By following these steps, we can systematically approach the problem and derive the solution using the given schema and SQL query.",,

Here's how we can approach the problem:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to find the number of arrests for a specific type of crime (""solicit on public way"" under ""prostitution"") in a specific community area (""West Garfield Park"").  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - The `Community_Area` table contains information about community areas, including their names and numbers.    - The `Crime` table contains crime reports, including details like the community area number, arrest status, and IUCR number.    - The `IUCR` table provides descriptions for crimes, including primary and secondary descriptions.  3. **Determine Relationships Between Tables**:    - The `Community_Area` table can be linked to the `Crime` table using the `community_area_no` column.    - The `Crime` table can be linked to the `IUCR` table using the `iucr_no` column.  4. **Filter for the Specific Community Area**:    - Use the `Community_Area` table to filter crimes that occurred in ""West Garfield Park"". This involves selecting rows where `community_area_name` is ""West Garfield Park"".  5. **Filter for the Specific Crime Type**:    - Use the `IUCR` table to filter crimes that have the primary description ""PROSTITUTION"" and the secondary description ""SOLICIT ON PUBLIC WAY"".  6. **Join Tables**:    - Perform an `INNER JOIN` between the `Community_Area` and `Crime` tables on `community_area_no` to get crimes that occurred in West Garfield Park.    - Perform another `INNER JOIN` between the resulting dataset and the `IUCR` table on `iucr_no` to filter for the specific crime type.  7. **Count Arrests**:    - Use a `CASE` statement within a `SUM` function to count the number of arrests. The `CASE` statement checks if the `arrest` column in the `Crime` table is 'TRUE', and if so, it adds 1 to the sum.  8. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Combine all the above steps into a single SQL query:            SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN T2.arrest = 'TRUE' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)      FROM Community_Area AS T1      INNER JOIN Crime AS T2 ON T1.community_area_no = T2.community_area_no      INNER JOIN IUCR AS T3 ON T2.iucr_no = T3.iucr_no      WHERE T1.community_area_name = 'West Garfield Park'      AND T3.secondary_description = 'SOLICIT ON PUBLIC WAY'      AND T3.primary_description = 'PROSTITUTION'        By following these logical steps, we can effectively query the database to find the number of arrests for the specified crime in West Garfield Park.",,

The `Community_Area` table contains information about community areas, including their names and numbers. The `Neighborhood` table links neighborhoods to community areas via the `community_area_no` column.  2. **Identify the Target Community Area**:    - We are interested in the community area named ""Near North Side"". Therefore, we need to filter the `Community_Area` table to find rows where `community_area_name` is ""Near North Side"".  3. **Establish the Relationship**:    - Recognize that neighborhoods are linked to community areas through the `community_area_no` column. This means we need to join the `Community_Area` table with the `Neighborhood` table using this column.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Use an INNER JOIN to connect the `Community_Area` table with the `Neighborhood` table on the `community_area_no` column. This will allow us to retrieve neighborhoods that belong to the ""Near North Side"" community area.  5. **Count the Neighborhoods**:    - Use a conditional aggregation to count only those neighborhoods that belong to the ""Near North Side"". This can be done using a `CASE` statement within a `SUM` function to increment the count only when the `community_area_name` is ""Near North Side"".  6. **Write the SQL Statement**:    - Combine all these steps into a single SQL query:            SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN T1.community_area_name = 'Near North Side' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)      FROM Community_Area AS T1      INNER JOIN Neighborhood AS T2 ON T1.community_area_no = T2.community_area_no        7. **Verify the Logic**:    - Ensure that the query correctly counts the number of neighborhoods by checking that the join condition and the filtering condition are correctly applied.  By following these steps, we can logically derive the solution to count the number of neighborhoods in the ""Near North Side"" community area.",,

This can be achieved by using a conditional aggregation with `SUM` and `CASE` to count only those records where the `arrest` column is 'TRUE'.  7. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Combine all the above steps into a single SQL query:            SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN T2.arrest = 'TRUE' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)      FROM Ward AS T1      INNER JOIN Crime AS T2 ON T1.ward_no = T2.ward_no      WHERE T1.alderman_first_name = 'Walter'      AND T1.alderman_last_name = 'Burnett'      AND T1.alderman_name_suffix = 'Jr.'      AND T2.domestic = 'TRUE';        8. **Verify the Solution**:    - Ensure that the query correctly joins the tables, applies the necessary filters, and accurately counts the number of arrests for domestic violence incidents in the specified ward.  By following these logical steps, we can systematically arrive at the solution to the SQL problem.",,

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logical reasoning that leads to the solution:  1. **Identify the Least Populated Community:**    - We start by identifying the community with the smallest population. This information is available in the `Community_Area` table, which contains the `population` column.    - We need to sort the communities by population in ascending order to find the least populated one.  2. **Link Crimes to Communities:**    - Next, we need to associate crimes with their respective communities. The `Crime` table contains a `community_area_no` column that links each crime to a community.    - We will join the `Community_Area` table with the `Crime` table on the `community_area_no` column to get crimes associated with each community.  3. **Identify the Most Frequent Crime in the Least Populated Community:**    - Once we have the crimes linked to the least populated community, we need to determine which crime occurs most frequently.    - The `Crime` table has a `fbi_code_no` column that categorizes each crime. We can use this to group the crimes and count their occurrences.  4. **Retrieve Crime Descriptions:**    - To get the short description of the crimes, we need to join the `Crime` table with the `FBI_Code` table using the `fbi_code_no` column.    - The `FBI_Code` table contains a `title` column that provides the short description of each crime.  5. **Combine Steps and Formulate the Query:**    - Combine the above steps into a single query:      - Join `Community_Area` with `Crime` to filter crimes by community.      - Join the result with `FBI_Code` to get the crime descriptions.      - Group by the `title` to count occurrences of each crime type.      - Order the results first by population (ascending) to focus on the least populated community, and then by the count of crimes (descending) to find the most frequent crime.      - Limit the result to one to get the most frequent crime in the least populated community.  6. **Write the SQL Query:**    - The final query is:            SELECT T3.title       FROM Community_Area AS T1       INNER JOIN Crime AS T2 ON T1.community_area_no = T2.community_area_no       INNER JOIN FBI_Code AS T3 ON T2.fbi_code_no = T3.fbi_code_no       GROUP BY T3.title       ORDER BY T1.population ASC, COUNT(T2.report_no) DESC       LIMIT 1;        By following these logical steps, we ensure that we accurately determine the most frequently committed crime in the least populated community and retrieve its short description.",,

Here's how we can approach the problem:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: We need to find the office address of the legislative district (ward) corresponding to the location ""010XX W LAKE ST"". This involves identifying the correct ward and then retrieving its office address.  2. **Analyze the Schema**: Examine the provided schema to identify relevant tables and columns. The key tables in this context are:    - `Crime`: Contains information about crimes, including the `block` where the crime occurred and the `ward_no` associated with that location.    - `Ward`: Contains information about wards, including the `ward_no` and `ward_office_address`.  3. **Identify the Key Columns**:    - From the `Crime` table, the `block` column will help us locate the specific block ""010XX W LAKE ST"".    - The `ward_no` column in both `Crime` and `Ward` tables will help us link the crime location to the corresponding ward.    - From the `Ward` table, the `ward_office_address` column will provide the required office address.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - **Join the Tables**: Use an `INNER JOIN` to connect the `Crime` table with the `Ward` table based on the `ward_no` column. This will allow us to map each crime location to its corresponding ward.    - **Filter the Results**: Use a `WHERE` clause to filter the records in the `Crime` table to only include the block ""010XX W LAKE ST"".    - **Select the Required Information**: Retrieve the `ward_office_address` from the `Ward` table.    - **Group the Results**: Use `GROUP BY` to ensure that the results are distinct and to handle any potential duplicates in the data.  5. **Write the SQL Query**:        SELECT T1.ward_office_address     FROM Ward AS T1     INNER JOIN Crime AS T2     ON T1.ward_no = T2.ward_no     WHERE T2.block = '010XX W LAKE ST'     GROUP BY T1.ward_office_address;      6. **Execute and Validate**: Run the query to ensure it returns the correct office address. Validate the results by checking against any known data or additional context if available.  By following these steps, we can systematically solve the problem and retrieve the desired information from the database.",,

We need to identify the ward represented by Edward Burke using the `alderman_first_name` and `alderman_last_name` columns.    - **Crime Table**: This table records crime incidents. We need to filter crimes based on the `ward_no`, `arrest` status, and `fbi_code_no`.    - **FBI_Code Table**: This table provides descriptions of crime types. We need to identify the `fbi_code_no` for vandalism using the `title` column.  3. **Join Tables**:    - Join the **Ward** and **Crime** tables on `ward_no` to associate crimes with the specific ward represented by Edward Burke.    - Join the **Crime** and **FBI_Code** tables on `fbi_code_no` to filter for vandalism crimes.  4. **Apply Filters**:    - Filter the **Ward** table to select the ward where `alderman_first_name` is 'Edward' and `alderman_last_name` is 'Burke'.    - Filter the **FBI_Code** table to select records where the `title` is 'Vandalism'.    - Filter the **Crime** table to select records where `arrest` is 'TRUE', indicating that an arrest was made.  5. **Count the Number of Vandalism Arrests**:    - Use a `CASE` statement within a `SUM` function to count the number of vandalism incidents that resulted in arrests for the specified ward. The `CASE` statement checks if the alderman is Edward Burke and increments the count accordingly.  6. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Combine all the above steps into a coherent SQL query that joins the necessary tables, applies the filters, and calculates the count of vandalism arrests.  By following these logical steps, we can construct the SQL query to solve the problem:   SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN T1.alderman_last_name = 'Burke' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) FROM Ward AS T1 INNER JOIN Crime AS T2 ON T1.ward_no = T2.ward_no INNER JOIN FBI_Code AS T3 ON T2.fbi_code_no = T3.fbi_code_no WHERE T3.title = 'Vandalism' AND T2.arrest = 'TRUE' AND T1.alderman_first_name = 'Edward';   This query effectively counts the number of vandalism incidents that resulted in arrests in the ward represented by Edward Burke.",,

This involves filtering data based on both date and whether the case is domestic.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**: From the schema provided, the `Crime` table is most relevant because it contains information about individual crime reports, including the date of the report and whether it was a domestic case.  3. **Focus on Relevant Columns**:    - **`date`**: This column will be used to filter records to only those reported in May 2018.    - **`domestic`**: This column indicates whether a case is domestic. We need to filter for cases where this column is marked as 'TRUE'.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - **Filter by Date**: Since we need cases from May 2018, we can use a pattern matching approach with the `LIKE` operator. The date format in the samples is 'MM/DD/YYYY', so we look for dates starting with '5/' and ending with '/2018'.    - **Filter by Domestic Cases**: We need to include only those records where the `domestic` column is 'TRUE'.  5. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Use the `SELECT COUNT(*)` statement to count the number of records that meet the criteria.    - Apply the `WHERE` clause to filter records based on the date and domestic status.  6. **Write the Final Query**:        SELECT COUNT(*)     FROM Crime     WHERE date LIKE '5/%/2018%'     AND domestic = 'TRUE';      7. **Verify the Query**: Ensure that the query logic aligns with the problem requirements. The use of `LIKE '5/%/2018%'` correctly targets May 2018, and `domestic = 'TRUE'` filters for domestic violence cases.  By following these steps, we logically arrive at the solution to count the number of domestic violence cases reported in May 2018 using the given schema and data.",,

The problem requires us to list the IUCR numbers and index status of homicide incidents. Here's how we can approach this:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to find the IUCR numbers and index status for incidents classified as homicides.  2. **Examine the Schema**:    - We have several tables, but the relevant ones for this problem are `IUCR` and `Crime`.    - The `IUCR` table contains columns `iucr_no`, `primary_description`, `secondary_description`, and `index_code`.    - The `Crime` table contains columns `report_no`, `iucr_no`, and other details about the crime.  3. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - The `IUCR` table is crucial because it contains the `primary_description` column, which can be used to filter for homicides.    - The `index_code` column in the `IUCR` table is also important as it provides the index status of the crime.    - The `iucr_no` column in the `IUCR` table will give us the IUCR numbers.  4. **Determine the Filtering Criteria**:    - We need to filter the records where the `primary_description` is 'HOMICIDE'. This will help us identify the IUCR numbers related to homicide incidents.  5. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - We need to select the `iucr_no` and `index_code` from the `IUCR` table where the `primary_description` is 'HOMICIDE'.    - The SQL query should look like this:            SELECT iucr_no, index_code       FROM IUCR       WHERE primary_description = 'HOMICIDE';        6. **Verify the Solution**:    - Ensure that the query correctly lists the IUCR numbers and index status for all records where the primary description is 'HOMICIDE'.  By following these logical steps, we can derive the solution to the problem, ensuring that we correctly identify and extract the necessary data from the database schema provided.",,

Here's how we can approach the problem:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: The task is to find the responsible person and their email address for the Chicago Lawn area. This implies we need to identify which table contains information about responsible persons and their contact details.  2. **Analyze the Schema**: Review the provided schema to identify which tables might contain relevant information. We have several tables: `Community_Area`, `District`, `FBI_Code`, `IUCR`, `Neighborhood`, `Ward`, and `Crime`.  3. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - The `District` table contains columns related to responsible persons (`commander`) and their contact information (`email`), making it a candidate for our query.    - The `Community_Area` table might be relevant if it contains the name ""Chicago Lawn,"" but it does not directly contain information about responsible persons or email addresses.  4. **Determine the Relationship**: Since the problem asks for the responsible person of ""Chicago Lawn,"" we need to determine if ""Chicago Lawn"" is a district or a community area. Given the schema and typical naming conventions, ""Chicago Lawn"" is likely a district.  5. **Formulate the Query**:    - Since we have identified that the `District` table contains the necessary information, we need to filter this table to find the district named ""Chicago Lawn.""    - The columns of interest are `commander` and `email`, which will provide the responsible person's name and their email address.  6. **Write the SQL Query**: Based on the above analysis, the SQL query should select the `commander` and `email` columns from the `District` table where the `district_name` is ""Chicago Lawn.""  7. **Execute and Verify**: Run the query and verify that it returns the expected results, ensuring that the responsible person and their email address for the Chicago Lawn district are correctly retrieved.  The final SQL query is:  SELECT commander, email FROM District WHERE district_name = 'Chicago Lawn';   By following these steps, we logically deduce the necessary query to solve the problem based on the given schema and requirements.",,

Here's how we can approach the problem:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: We need to find the full name of the alderman from the ward with the highest population. This means we need to identify which ward has the largest population and then retrieve the alderman's name for that ward.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:     - The `Ward` table contains information about each ward, including the alderman's name and the population of the ward.    - Relevant columns in the `Ward` table are `alderman_first_name`, `alderman_last_name`, `alderman_name_suffix`, and `Population`.  3. **Determine the Key Metric**: The key metric here is the population of each ward. We need to compare the population values to determine which ward is the most crowded.  4. **Formulate the Query**:    - We need to sort the wards by their population in descending order to identify the ward with the highest population.    - Once sorted, we can select the top record, which will correspond to the ward with the highest population.  5. **Select the Required Information**: After identifying the most crowded ward, we need to retrieve the alderman's full name. This includes the first name, last name, and any suffix.  6. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Use the `SELECT` statement to retrieve `alderman_name_suffix`, `alderman_first_name`, and `alderman_last_name`.    - Use the `ORDER BY` clause to sort the records by `Population` in descending order.    - Use the `LIMIT` clause to select only the top record, which represents the most crowded ward.  7. **Verify the Solution**: Ensure that the query correctly retrieves the alderman's full name for the ward with the highest population.  By following these steps, we arrive at the SQL query:   SELECT alderman_name_suffix, alderman_first_name, alderman_last_name  FROM Ward  ORDER BY Population DESC  LIMIT 1;   This query effectively identifies and retrieves the full name of the alderman from the most crowded ward.",,

This implies filtering data based on a specific geographical designation.  2. **Review the Schema**:    - Examine the schema provided to identify which table contains relevant information about community areas and their geographical sides.    - The `Community_Area` table contains columns such as `community_area_name` and `side`, which are relevant to our query.  3. **Identify the Relevant Table and Columns**:    - The `Community_Area` table is the primary table of interest because it contains both `community_area_name` and `side`, which are necessary to filter by geographical location.    - Specifically, focus on the `side` column to determine which community areas are in the Northwest.  4. **Formulate the Query**:    - To retrieve the community area names in the Northwest, we need to select `community_area_name` from the `Community_Area` table where the `side` is 'Northwest'.    - The SQL query should look like this:            SELECT community_area_name FROM Community_Area WHERE side = 'Northwest';        5. **Verify the Query**:    - Double-check the query to ensure it correctly specifies the condition for filtering community areas by the 'Northwest' side.    - Ensure that the column names and table names are correctly referenced as per the schema.  6. **Consider Edge Cases**:    - Consider if there are any potential edge cases, such as variations in the naming of the 'Northwest' side (e.g., different capitalizations or abbreviations), and ensure the query accounts for these if necessary.  7. **Execute and Validate**:    - Execute the query in the database to retrieve the desired results.    - Validate the output to ensure it matches the expected community area names located in the Northwest.  By following these steps, we can logically arrive at the solution to the problem of listing community area names in the Northwest using the given schema.",,

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement:**    - The task is to list down the titles and descriptions of crime cases specifically against persons.  2. **Analyze the Schema:**    - We have multiple tables, but the relevant table for this problem is the `FBI_Code` table because it contains information about crime titles, descriptions, and the category of crime (i.e., `crime_against`).  3. **Identify Relevant Columns:**    - From the `FBI_Code` table, the columns of interest are:      - `title`: This column contains the titles of the crimes.      - `description`: This column provides descriptions of the crimes.      - `crime_against`: This column indicates the category of crime, which includes 'Persons', 'Property', etc.  4. **Formulate the Query:**    - Since we need to filter crimes against persons, we should use the `crime_against` column to filter the data.    - The SQL `SELECT` statement will be used to retrieve the `title` and `description` of the crimes where `crime_against` is 'Persons'.  5. **Construct the SQL Query:**    - Use the `SELECT` statement to specify the columns `title` and `description`.    - Use the `FROM` clause to specify the `FBI_Code` table.    - Use the `WHERE` clause to filter records where `crime_against = 'Persons'`.  6. **Verify the Solution:**    - Ensure that the query correctly retrieves only the titles and descriptions of crimes categorized as against persons.  By following these steps, the SQL query is constructed as follows:   SELECT title, description  FROM FBI_Code  WHERE crime_against = 'Persons';   This query effectively extracts the required information by focusing on the relevant table and applying the appropriate filter condition.",,

Also, ensure that there is no name suffix by checking `alderman_name_suffix IS NULL`.    - **Filter by Date**: Use the `LIKE` operator to filter the `date` column in the `Crime` table to only include records from 7th October 2018. The date format in the `Crime` table appears to be `MM/DD/YYYY`, so use `LIKE '10/7/2018%'`.  5. **Construct the Final SQL Query**:    - The final query should look like this:   SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN T2.alderman_last_name = 'Reilly' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) FROM Crime AS T1 INNER JOIN Ward AS T2 ON T1.ward_no = T2.ward_no WHERE T2.alderman_name_suffix IS NULL AND T2.alderman_first_name = 'Brendan' AND date LIKE '10/7/2018%'   6. **Review and Test the Query**:    - Ensure that the query correctly counts the number of crimes handled by Brendan Reilly on the specified date by testing it against the database.  By following these steps, we can systematically determine the number of crimes associated with Brendan Reilly on the given date using the provided database schema.",,

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logical steps to arrive at the solution:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to count the number of arrests for crimes that occurred in restaurants located in the Englewood district.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - The `Crime` table contains information about each crime, including whether an arrest was made (`arrest` column), the location of the crime (`location_description` column), and the district number (`district_no` column).    - The `District` table contains information about each district, including the district name (`district_name` column) and district number (`district_no` column).  3. **Determine the Join Condition**:    - To link crimes to their respective districts, we need to join the `Crime` table with the `District` table using the `district_no` column, which is common in both tables.  4. **Filter for Specific Conditions**:    - We need to filter the results to only include crimes that occurred in the Englewood district. This can be done by setting a condition on the `district_name` column to 'Englewood'.    - Additionally, we need to filter for crimes that happened in a restaurant. This requires setting a condition on the `location_description` column to 'RESTAURANT'.  5. **Count Arrests**:    - We need to count the number of cases where an arrest was made. This can be achieved by using a conditional aggregation. Specifically, we can use a `CASE` statement within a `SUM` function to count only those records where the `arrest` column is 'TRUE'.  6. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Using the insights from the previous steps, construct the SQL query to perform the necessary joins, apply the filters, and count the arrests.  Here's the final SQL query based on these steps:   SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN T1.arrest = 'TRUE' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)  FROM Crime AS T1  INNER JOIN District AS T2 ON T1.district_no = T2.district_no  WHERE T2.district_name = 'Englewood'  AND T1.location_description = 'RESTAURANT';   This query joins the `Crime` and `District` tables on the `district_no` column, filters for crimes in the Englewood district that occurred in restaurants, and counts the number of cases where an arrest was made.",,

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logical reasoning that could lead to the solution:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: We need to find case numbers, aldermen's full names, and district names for crimes that happened at ""0000X N FRANCISCO AVE"".  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - **Crime Table**: This table contains information about crimes, including the `case_number`, `block` (which indicates the location of the crime), `district_no`, and `ward_no`.    - **District Table**: This table includes `district_no` and `district_name`, which will help us get the district name associated with the crime.    - **Ward Table**: This table contains `ward_no`, `alderman_first_name`, and `alderman_last_name`, which will help us get the full name of the alderman associated with the crime.  3. **Determine the Required Joins**:    - We need to join the **Crime** table with the **District** table using `district_no` to get the `district_name`.    - We also need to join the **Crime** table with the **Ward** table using `ward_no` to get the alderman's full name.  4. **Filter the Data**:    - We need to filter the records in the **Crime** table to only include those where the `block` is ""0000X N FRANCISCO AVE"".  5. **Select the Required Columns**:    - From the **Crime** table, we need the `case_number`.    - From the **Ward** table, we need `alderman_first_name` and `alderman_last_name`.    - From the **District** table, we need `district_name`.  6. **Group the Results**:    - Since we are aggregating data from multiple tables and want unique combinations of case numbers, aldermen's names, and district names, we should use a `GROUP BY` clause to ensure each combination is unique.  7. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Using the above logic, construct the SQL query to join the tables, apply the filter, and select the required columns.  Here's the SQL query that implements the above steps:   SELECT      T2.case_number,      T3.alderman_first_name,      T3.alderman_last_name,      T1.district_name  FROM      District AS T1  INNER JOIN      Crime AS T2 ON T1.district_no = T2.district_no  INNER JOIN      Ward AS T3 ON T2.ward_no = T3.ward_no  WHERE      T2.block = '0000X N FRANCISCO AVE'  GROUP BY      T2.case_number,      T3.alderman_first_name,      T3.alderman_last_name,      T1.district_name;   By following these logical steps, we ensure that we retrieve the correct information as required by the problem statement.",,

Here's how we can approach the problem:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: We need to count the number of crimes that are categorized as ""Misc Non-Index Offense."" This requires identifying the relevant data columns and tables that contain this information.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - The `FBI_Code` table contains the `title` column, which describes the type of offense, including ""Misc Non-Index Offense.""    - The `Crime` table contains the `fbi_code_no` column, which links to the `FBI_Code` table, allowing us to categorize each crime.  3. **Determine the Relationship Between Tables**:    - The `Crime` table and the `FBI_Code` table are related through the `fbi_code_no` column. This relationship allows us to join these tables and filter crimes based on their FBI code titles.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - We need to perform an INNER JOIN between the `Crime` and `FBI_Code` tables on the `fbi_code_no` column to combine the crime records with their corresponding FBI code descriptions.    - Use a CASE statement to count only those records where the `title` in the `FBI_Code` table is ""Misc Non-Index Offense.""    - Use the SUM function to aggregate the results of the CASE statement, effectively counting the number of relevant crimes.  5. **Write the SQL Query**:    - The SQL query should select the sum of the CASE statement that checks for the ""Misc Non-Index Offense"" title. This query will give us the total count of such crimes.  Here's the SQL query based on the above reasoning:   SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN T1.title = 'Misc Non-Index Offense' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) FROM FBI_Code AS T1 INNER JOIN Crime AS T2 ON T2.fbi_code_no = T1.fbi_code_no;   6. **Verify the Query**:    - Ensure that the query correctly joins the tables and accurately counts the crimes with the specified title.    - Test the query with sample data to confirm its correctness.  By following these steps, we systematically address the problem and arrive at a solution that accurately counts the number of ""Misc Non-Index Offense"" crimes.",,

This requires sorting the `Community_Area` table by the `population` column in descending order and selecting the top entry.  4. **Join the Tables**:    - Use an INNER JOIN between `Community_Area` and `Crime` on the `community_area_no` column to associate each crime with its respective community area.  5. **Count the Crimes**:    - For the community area with the highest population, count the number of crime reports. This is achieved by using the `COUNT` function on `report_no`.  6. **Calculate the Average Crime Rate per Month**:    - Since the problem specifies calculating the average per month, divide the total number of crimes by 12 (the number of months in a year).  7. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Start by selecting the `community_area_no` and `population` from `Community_Area`.    - Use a subquery or a HAVING clause to filter for the community area with the maximum population.    - Join the `Crime` table and count the `report_no` for the selected community area.    - Divide the count by 12 to get the average monthly crime rate.  8. **Order and Limit the Results**:    - Ensure the results are ordered by population in descending order to pick the highest populous area.    - Use `LIMIT 1` to select only the top result.  Here is the SQL query that implements these steps:   SELECT CAST(COUNT(T2.report_no) AS REAL) / 12 FROM Community_Area AS T1 INNER JOIN Crime AS T2 ON T2.community_area_no = T1.community_area_no GROUP BY T1.community_area_no HAVING COUNT(T1.population) ORDER BY COUNT(T1.population) DESC LIMIT 1;   By following these logical steps, we ensure that the solution accurately calculates the average crime rate per month for the community area with the highest population.",,

Here's a breakdown of how we can approach this problem:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to calculate the percentage of larceny incidents among all crimes that occurred in the Central area.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - The `Community_Area` table contains information about different community areas, including their names and sides.    - The `Crime` table contains details about each crime, including the `report_no`, `iucr_no`, `district_no`, and `community_area_no`.    - The `FBI_Code` table contains information about different types of crimes, including their titles and descriptions.  3. **Determine Necessary Joins**:    - To find crimes in the Central area, we need to join the `Crime` table with the `Community_Area` table on the `community_area_no` column.    - To identify which crimes are larceny, we need to join the `Crime` table with the `FBI_Code` table on the `fbi_code_no` column.  4. **Filter for the Central Area**:    - Use a `WHERE` clause to filter the results to only include crimes that occurred in the Central area. This can be done by checking the `side` column in the `Community_Area` table for the value 'Central'.  5. **Count Total Crimes in Central**:    - Count the total number of crime reports in the Central area using `COUNT(T2.report_no)`.  6. **Count Larceny Crimes in Central**:    - Use a `CASE` statement within `COUNT` to count only those crimes where the `title` in the `FBI_Code` table is 'Larceny'.  7. **Calculate the Percentage**:    - Calculate the percentage of larceny crimes by dividing the count of larceny crimes by the total count of crimes and multiplying by 100.    - Use `CAST` to ensure the division results in a real number for accurate percentage calculation.  8. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Combine all these steps into a single SQL query to get the desired result.  Here's the SQL query that implements these steps:   SELECT      CAST(COUNT(CASE WHEN T3.title = 'Larceny' THEN T2.report_no END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(T2.report_no)  FROM      Community_Area AS T1  INNER JOIN      Crime AS T2 ON T2.community_area_no = T1.community_area_no  INNER JOIN      FBI_Code AS T3 ON T3.fbi_code_no = T2.fbi_code_no  WHERE      T1.side = 'Central'   By following these logical steps, we can accurately calculate the percentage of larceny incidents among all crimes in the Central area.",,

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logical reasoning to arrive at the solution:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement:**    - We need to find the location descriptions and aldermen's full names for crimes where the primary description is ""Arson"" and the secondary description is ""By Explosive.""  2. **Identify Relevant Tables:**    - From the schema, identify the tables that contain information related to the problem:      - `Crime`: Contains details about each crime, including `location_description`, `ward_no`, and `iucr_no`.      - `IUCR`: Contains the `primary_description` and `secondary_description` of crimes, which will help us filter for ""Arson by Explosive.""      - `Ward`: Contains aldermen's information, including `alderman_first_name`, `alderman_last_name`, and `alderman_name_suffix`.  3. **Determine Necessary Joins:**    - To access the aldermen's full names and location descriptions for specific crimes, we need to join the tables:      - Join `Crime` and `Ward` on `ward_no` to get the aldermen's details for each crime.      - Join `Crime` and `IUCR` on `iucr_no` to filter crimes based on their descriptions.  4. **Filter the Data:**    - Use the `IUCR` table to filter crimes where `primary_description` is ""Arson"" and `secondary_description` is ""By Explosive.""  5. **Select Required Columns:**    - From the joined tables, select the columns needed for the output:      - `location_description` from the `Crime` table.      - `alderman_first_name`, `alderman_last_name`, and `alderman_name_suffix` from the `Ward` table to construct the full name of the alderman.  6. **Construct the SQL Query:**    - Write the SQL query using the identified joins and filters:            SELECT T2.location_description,              T1.alderman_first_name,              T1.alderman_last_name,              T1.alderman_name_suffix       FROM Ward AS T1       INNER JOIN Crime AS T2 ON T2.ward_no = T1.ward_no       INNER JOIN IUCR AS T3 ON T3.iucr_no = T2.iucr_no       WHERE T3.primary_description = 'ARSON'         AND T3.secondary_description = 'BY EXPLOSIVE';        7. **Verify the Query:**    - Ensure that the query correctly joins the tables and applies the necessary filters to produce the desired output.  By following these logical steps, we can systematically construct a query that retrieves the required information about arson by explosive incidents, including the location descriptions and the full names of the aldermen associated with those incidents.",,

This column acts as a foreign key in the `Crime` table, linking it to the `IUCR` table.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - We need to join the `Crime` and `IUCR` tables to filter crimes based on the specific descriptions provided: ""DECEPTIVE PRACTICE"" and ""UNLAWFUL USE OF RECORDED SOUND.""    - Use an INNER JOIN to combine rows from both tables where the `iucr_no` matches.  5. **Select the Required Columns**:    - From the `Crime` table, select the `date`, `latitude`, and `longitude` columns to get the occurrence date and location of the crime.  6. **Apply the Filtering Conditions**:    - Use a WHERE clause to filter the joined results based on the `primary_description` and `secondary_description` in the `IUCR` table.  7. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Combine all the above steps into a coherent SQL query:            SELECT T2.date, T2.latitude, T2.longitude      FROM IUCR AS T1      INNER JOIN Crime AS T2 ON T2.iucr_no = T1.iucr_no      WHERE T1.primary_description = 'DECEPTIVE PRACTICE'      AND T1.secondary_description = 'UNLAWFUL USE OF RECORDED SOUND';        By following these logical steps, we can construct a query that accurately retrieves the required information based on the given problem statement and schema.",,

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logical reasoning process to arrive at the solution:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement:**    - We need to count the number of criminal sexual assault cases that happened in residences in a specific district.    - The district is identified by the commander, Adnardo Gutierrez.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns:**    - **Crime Table:** Contains information about each crime, including `report_no`, `iucr_no`, `location_description`, `district_no`, and `fbi_code_no`.    - **District Table:** Contains district information, including `district_no` and `commander`.    - **FBI_Code Table:** Contains crime classifications, including `fbi_code_no` and `title`.  3. **Determine Necessary Joins:**    - We need to join the `Crime` table with the `District` table to filter crimes by the district commanded by Adnardo Gutierrez.    - We also need to join the `Crime` table with the `FBI_Code` table to filter crimes by the type ""Criminal Sexual Assault"".  4. **Formulate the Conditions:**    - **Crime Type Condition:** Use the `FBI_Code` table to filter crimes where `title` is ""Criminal Sexual Assault"".    - **District Condition:** Use the `District` table to filter crimes where the `commander` is ""Adnardo Gutierrez"".    - **Location Condition:** Use the `Crime` table to filter crimes where `location_description` is ""RESIDENCE"".  5. **Construct the SQL Query:**    - Start by selecting the count of `report_no` from the `Crime` table, as this uniquely identifies each crime report.    - Perform an INNER JOIN between `Crime` and `District` on `district_no` to filter by the district commander.    - Perform an INNER JOIN between `Crime` and `FBI_Code` on `fbi_code_no` to filter by the crime type.    - Apply the WHERE clause to enforce the conditions identified in step 4.  6. **Write and Validate the SQL Query:**    - The final SQL query is:            SELECT COUNT(T2.report_no)      FROM District AS T1      INNER JOIN Crime AS T2 ON T2.district_no = T1.district_no      INNER JOIN FBI_Code AS T3 ON T3.fbi_code_no = T2.fbi_code_no      WHERE T3.title = 'Criminal Sexual Assault'      AND T1.commander = 'Adnardo Gutierrez'      AND T2.location_description = 'RESIDENCE';          - Validate the query by ensuring that all conditions are correctly implemented and that the joins are properly set up to connect the necessary tables.

Here’s a breakdown of the thought process:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement:**    - We need to calculate the percentage of domestic violence cases that resulted in arrests specifically in the West Pullman community area.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns:**    - From the schema, we identify that the `Community_Area` and `Crime` tables are relevant.    - The `Community_Area` table contains the `community_area_name` column, which we can use to filter for West Pullman.    - The `Crime` table contains the `domestic` column to identify domestic violence cases and the `arrest` column to check if an arrest was made.  3. **Determine the Join Condition:**    - We need to join the `Community_Area` and `Crime` tables. The common column between these tables is `community_area_no`.  4. **Filter for West Pullman and Domestic Violence Cases:**    - Use a `WHERE` clause to filter the data for the community area name 'West Pullman' and where `domestic` is `TRUE`.  5. **Calculate the Total Number of Domestic Violence Cases:**    - Use `COUNT(T2.report_no)` to count all domestic violence cases in West Pullman.  6. **Calculate the Number of Arrests in Domestic Violence Cases:**    - Use `COUNT(CASE WHEN T2.arrest = 'TRUE' THEN T2.report_no END)` to count only those cases where an arrest was made.  7. **Calculate the Percentage:**    - Divide the number of arrests by the total number of domestic violence cases and multiply by 100 to get the percentage.    - Convert the count to a real number to ensure proper division and avoid integer division issues.  8. **Formulate the SQL Query:**    - Combine all the above steps into a single SQL query:            SELECT CAST(COUNT(CASE WHEN T2.arrest = 'TRUE' THEN T2.report_no END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(T2.report_no)      FROM Community_Area AS T1      INNER JOIN Crime AS T2 ON T2.community_area_no = T1.community_area_no      WHERE T1.community_area_name = 'West Pullman' AND T2.domestic = 'TRUE'        By following these logical steps, we can systematically address the problem and arrive at the correct SQL solution.",,

Here's a breakdown of the logical steps to reach the solution:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to calculate the percentage of domestic violence cases handled by Christopher Taliaferro.    - We also need to identify the report numbers of those cases that occurred in a bank.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - The `Crime` table contains information about each crime, including whether it is domestic (`domestic` column), the report number (`report_no` column), and the location description (`location_description` column).    - The `Ward` table contains information about the aldermen, including their first and last names (`alderman_first_name` and `alderman_last_name` columns).  3. **Determine the Relationship Between Tables**:    - The `Crime` table has a `ward_no` column that can be joined with the `Ward` table's `ward_no` column to associate crimes with the respective alderman.  4. **Filter for Relevant Data**:    - We need to filter the data to only include crimes handled by Christopher Taliaferro. This can be done by joining the `Crime` table with the `Ward` table on `ward_no` and filtering where `alderman_first_name` is 'Christopher' and `alderman_last_name` is 'Taliaferro'.  5. **Calculate the Total Number of Cases**:    - Count the total number of cases handled by Christopher Taliaferro using `COUNT(T1.report_no)`.  6. **Calculate the Number of Domestic Cases**:    - Use a conditional count to determine the number of domestic cases. This can be achieved with `COUNT(CASE WHEN T1.domestic = 'TRUE' THEN T1.report_no END)`.  7. **Calculate the Percentage of Domestic Cases**:    - Calculate the percentage of domestic cases by dividing the count of domestic cases by the total number of cases and multiplying by 100. Use `CAST` to ensure the division results in a real number.  8. **Identify Cases that Occurred in a Bank**:    - Use another conditional count to identify the number of domestic cases that occurred in a bank.

This requires identifying the correct table and column that store aldermen's first names.  2. **Review the Schema**: Examine the provided schema to identify which table contains information about aldermen. The schema lists several tables, but only the `Ward` table contains columns related to aldermen.  3. **Identify Relevant Columns**: Within the `Ward` table, locate the column that stores aldermen's first names. The column `alderman_first_name` is the one that holds this information.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - **Select the Table**: Since the information is in the `Ward` table, this is the table to query.    - **Specify the Condition**: We need to filter rows where the `alderman_first_name` is ""James"". This is done using a `WHERE` clause.    - **Count the Results**: Since the question asks for the number of aldermen, use the `COUNT(*)` function to count the rows that meet the condition.  5. **Construct the SQL Query**: Combine the above elements into a complete SQL query:        SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Ward WHERE alderman_first_name = 'James';      6. **Verify the Solution**: Double-check that the query accurately reflects the problem statement and that all necessary conditions are included. Ensure that the query will return a single number representing the count of aldermen named ""James"".  By following these steps, you can logically arrive at the solution to the problem using the provided schema and SQL query.",,

The `Crime` table is relevant as it contains details about each crime, including the date.  3. **Locate the Date Column**:    - Within the `Crime` table, identify the column that records the date of each crime. The column named `date` is the one we need.  4. **Determine the Date Format**:    - Examine the sample data in the `date` column to understand its format. The samples show a format of `MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM`.  5. **Formulate the Query**:    - We need to count the number of records where the date matches January 1, 2018. Since the time is also included in the `date` column, we can use a pattern matching approach to filter for the specific date.    - Use the SQL `LIKE` operator to match the date string pattern `'1/1/2018%'`. The `%` wildcard allows us to ignore the time part of the date.  6. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Construct the SQL query to count the number of crimes on January 1, 2018:            SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Crime WHERE date LIKE '1/1/2018%'        7. **Verify the Query**:    - Ensure that the query correctly counts all records where the date starts with '1/1/2018', which includes any time on that day.

Here's how we can approach the problem:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to calculate the average population of community areas specifically located on the West side. This implies filtering the data based on the 'side' attribute.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - From the schema provided, the `Community_Area` table contains information about community areas, including their population and the side of the city they are located on.    - The relevant columns in the `Community_Area` table are `side` and `population`.  3. **Filter Data Based on Criteria**:    - We need to filter the rows in the `Community_Area` table where the `side` column has the value 'West '. This will allow us to focus only on the community areas located on the West side.  4. **Calculate the Average**:    - Once we have filtered the data to include only the West side community areas, we need to calculate the average of their populations. This requires using the SQL `AVG()` function on the `population` column.  5. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Combine the filtering and aggregation steps into a single SQL query:            SELECT AVG(population) FROM Community_Area WHERE side = 'West '          - This query selects the average population from the `Community_Area` table, filtered by the condition that the `side` is 'West '.  6. **Verify the Solution**:    - Ensure that the query correctly reflects the problem statement and that the syntax is correct. Double-check that the `side` value matches the exact string used in the database (including any spaces or case sensitivity).  By following these steps, we can logically derive the solution to calculate the average population of community areas on the West side.",,

Here's how we can approach the problem:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement:**    - We need to find the report number of a crime that occurred in the ward represented by Edward Burke and in the community area with the highest population. Additionally, the crime should have the highest beat number.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns:**    - We need to work with the `Ward`, `Crime`, and `Community_Area` tables.    - From the `Ward` table, we need to filter by the alderman named Edward Burke.    - From the `Crime` table, we need the `report_no`, `ward_no`, `community_area_no`, and `beat`.    - From the `Community_Area` table, we need the `community_area_no` and `population`.  3. **Filter by Alderman:**    - Start by filtering the `Ward` table to find the ward(s) where Edward Burke is the alderman. This can be done using a `WHERE` clause on `alderman_first_name` and `alderman_last_name`.  4. **Join Tables:**    - Perform an `INNER JOIN` between the `Ward` and `Crime` tables on `ward_no` to get crimes reported in Edward Burke's ward.    - Perform another `INNER JOIN` between the `Crime` and `Community_Area` tables on `community_area_no` to link crimes to their respective community areas.  5. **Order by Beat and Population:**    - To find the crime with the highest beat number, use `ORDER BY T2.beat DESC`.    - To ensure it is in the community area with the highest population, also order by `T3.population DESC`.  6. **Limit the Results:**    - Since we need only the report number of the crime with the highest beat, use `LIMIT 1` to get the top result after ordering.  7. **Select the Desired Column:**    - Finally, select the `report_no` from the `Crime` table as it is the required output.  By following these steps, we can construct the SQL query to solve the problem efficiently. The solution query is:   SELECT T2.report_no  FROM Ward AS T1  INNER JOIN Crime AS T2 ON T2.ward_no = T1.ward_no  INNER JOIN Community_Area AS T3 ON T3.community_area_no = T2.community_area_no  WHERE T1.alderman_first_name = 'Edward'  AND T1.alderman_last_name = 'Burke'  ORDER BY T2.beat DESC, T3.population DESC  LIMIT 1;   This query effectively filters, joins, orders, and limits the data to provide the desired result.",,

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logical reasoning process to arrive at the solution:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to count the number of crimes that have occurred on the street.    - The crimes should have the FBI title ""Homicide 1st & 2nd Degree.""  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - From the problem statement, the relevant tables are `FBI_Code` and `Crime`.    - In the `FBI_Code` table, the columns of interest are `fbi_code_no` and `title`.    - In the `Crime` table, the columns of interest are `fbi_code_no` and `location_description`.  3. **Determine the Relationship Between Tables**:    - The `Crime` table contains a foreign key `fbi_code_no` that links to the `FBI_Code` table.    - This relationship allows us to join these tables to filter crimes based on the FBI title.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - **Join the Tables**: Use an INNER JOIN to connect `Crime` and `FBI_Code` tables on the `fbi_code_no` column.    - **Filter by FBI Title**: Use a WHERE clause to filter records where `title` is ""Homicide 1st & 2nd Degree"".    - **Filter by Location**: Use a CASE statement to count only those crimes where `location_description` is ""STREET"".    - **Aggregate the Results**: Use SUM to count the number of crimes that meet both criteria.  5. **Write the SQL Query**:    - The query should select the sum of a conditional count (using CASE) to count only those crimes that occurred on the street and have the specified FBI title.  6. **Verify the Query**:    - Ensure the query logic aligns with the problem requirements.    - Check that the join condition and filters are correctly applied.  Here's the final SQL query based on the above reasoning:   SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN T2.location_description = 'STREET' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) FROM FBI_Code AS T1 INNER JOIN Crime AS T2 ON T2.fbi_code_no = T1.fbi_code_no WHERE T1.title = 'Homicide 1st & 2nd Degree';   This query correctly counts the number of crimes that occurred on the street with the specified FBI title, using the relationships and conditions identified.",,

Milwaukee Ave.',"To solve the given SQL problem, we need to identify the logical steps that lead to the solution. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to find the report numbers of crimes that occurred inside apartments and were reported to the ward located at ""1958 N. Milwaukee Ave.""  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - From the schema, the `Crime` table contains information about crimes, including `report_no`, `location_description`, and `ward_no`.    - The `Ward` table contains information about wards, including `ward_office_address` and `ward_no`.  3. **Determine the Necessary Conditions**:    - We are interested in crimes where the `location_description` is 'APARTMENT'.    - We need to filter crimes reported to the specific ward located at ""1958 N. Milwaukee Ave."".  4. **Establish the Relationship Between Tables**:    - The `Crime` table and the `Ward` table can be linked using the `ward_no` column, which is common to both tables.  5. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Start by selecting the `report_no` from the `Crime` table since that is the information we need.    - Use an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Crime` and `Ward` tables based on the `ward_no` column.    - Apply a `WHERE` clause to filter for crimes with `location_description` as 'APARTMENT'.    - Further filter the results by ensuring the `ward_office_address` in the `Ward` table matches ""1958 N. Milwaukee Ave."".  6. **Write the SQL Query**:    - The final query is:            SELECT T1.report_no       FROM Crime AS T1       INNER JOIN Ward AS T2       ON T2.ward_no = T1.ward_no       WHERE T1.location_description = 'APARTMENT'       AND T2.ward_office_address = '1958 N. Milwaukee Ave.'        7. **Verify the Query**:    - Ensure the query logic aligns with the problem requirements and that all conditions are correctly implemented.  By following these logical steps, we arrive at the solution that accurately retrieves the desired data from the database.",,

This relationship allows us to filter crimes by community area name.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - **Join Tables**: Use an INNER JOIN to connect `Community_Area` and `Crime` tables on `community_area_no`.    - **Filter by Community Area Name**: Use a WHERE clause to filter records where `community_area_name` is 'Bridgeport'.    - **Filter by Beat Number**: Use a CASE WHEN statement to count only those crimes where the `beat` is less than 1000.    - **Aggregate the Results**: Use SUM to aggregate the total number of crimes that meet the criteria.  5. **Write the SQL Query**:        SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN T2.beat < 1000 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)     FROM Community_Area AS T1     INNER JOIN Crime AS T2     ON T2.community_area_no = T1.community_area_no     WHERE T1.community_area_name = 'Bridgeport';      6. **Verify the Query**:    - Ensure that the query logic aligns with the problem statement.    - Check that the join condition and filters are correctly applied.    - Confirm that the aggregation correctly sums the number of qualifying crimes.

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to list the report numbers of crimes that occurred in community areas located on the far north side with a population greater than 60,000.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - From the schema, the `Community_Area` table contains information about community areas, including their side and population.    - The `Crime` table contains crime reports, including the `report_no` and `community_area_no`.  3. **Determine the Required Conditions**:    - The community area must be on the ""Far North"" side.    - The population of the community area must be greater than 60,000.  4. **Establish the Relationship Between Tables**:    - The `Crime` table can be linked to the `Community_Area` table using the `community_area_no` column, which is common to both tables.  5. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Start by selecting the `report_no` from the `Crime` table.    - Use an INNER JOIN to connect the `Crime` table with the `Community_Area` table on the `community_area_no`.    - Apply the WHERE clause to filter community areas that are on the ""Far North"" side and have a population greater than 60,000.  6. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - The query should look like this:            SELECT T2.report_no      FROM Community_Area AS T1      INNER JOIN Crime AS T2 ON T2.community_area_no = T1.community_area_no      WHERE T1.side = 'Far North' AND T1.population > 60000;        7. **Verify the Solution**:    - Ensure that the query correctly retrieves the report numbers of crimes from the specified community areas by checking the logic and conditions applied.  By following these steps, we can logically derive the solution to the given SQL problem, ensuring that all conditions are met and the correct data is retrieved from the database.",,

Here's how you might approach the problem:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to find crimes categorized as ""against property"" that occurred in the community area named ""Riverdale.""  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - From the schema, the relevant tables are `FBI_Code`, `Crime`, and `Community_Area`.    - `FBI_Code` contains information about the type of crime, specifically the `crime_against` column which tells us if a crime is against property.    - `Crime` contains the actual crime reports, including `fbi_code_no` to link with `FBI_Code` and `community_area_no` to link with `Community_Area`.    - `Community_Area` contains the names of community areas, specifically `community_area_name` to identify ""Riverdale.""  3. **Determine the Relationships Between Tables**:    - The `Crime` table can be linked to the `FBI_Code` table using the `fbi_code_no` column.    - The `Crime` table can be linked to the `Community_Area` table using the `community_area_no` column.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - We need to filter crimes that are against property. This can be done by checking the `crime_against` column in the `FBI_Code` table for the value ""Property.""    - We need to filter crimes that occurred in Riverdale. This can be done by checking the `community_area_name` column in the `Community_Area` table for the value ""Riverdale.""  5. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Start by selecting the necessary columns and performing the required joins:            SELECT T2.report_no      FROM FBI_Code AS T1      INNER JOIN Crime AS T2 ON T2.fbi_code_no = T1.fbi_code_no      INNER JOIN Community_Area AS T3 ON T3.community_area_no = T2.community_area_no          - Add the conditions to filter for crimes against property and those that occurred in Riverdale:            WHERE T1.crime_against = 'Property' AND T3.community_area_name = 'Riverdale'        6. **Adjust the Query to Meet the Problem Requirements**:    - Since the problem asks for the report number of such crimes, we need to ensure the query returns the `report_no` from the `Crime` table.    - If the problem requires counting these crimes instead of listing them, we would modify the query to use an aggregate function like `COUNT` or `SUM`.  7. **Final Query**:    - Based on the solution provided, the final query counts the number of crimes against property in Riverdale:            SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN T1.crime_against = 'Property' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)      FROM FBI_Code AS T1      INNER JOIN Crime AS T2 ON T2.fbi_code_no = T1.fbi_code_no      INNER JOIN Community_Area AS T3 ON T3.community_area_no = T2.community_area_no      WHERE T3.community_area_name = 'Riverdale'        By following these logical steps, we can construct a query that accurately answers the problem statement using the given database schema.",,

This will allow us to associate each crime with its corresponding ward.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Start by writing a basic query to join the `Ward` and `Crime` tables on the `ward_no` column.    - Use a `WHERE` clause to filter the results to only include the ward with the email ""ward13@cityofchicago.org"".    - Use a `CASE` statement within a `SUM` function to count only those records where the `domestic` column is 'TRUE', indicating a domestic violence case.  5. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Construct the SQL query as follows:            SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN T2.domestic = 'TRUE' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)       FROM Ward AS T1       INNER JOIN Crime AS T2 ON T2.ward_no = T1.ward_no       WHERE T1.ward_email = 'ward13@cityofchicago.org'          - This query joins the `Ward` and `Crime` tables, filters for the specific ward email, and counts the number of domestic violence cases.  6. **Validate the Query**:    - Ensure that the query logic correctly reflects the problem statement and schema.    - Check that the query will correctly count only the domestic violence cases for the specified ward.  By following these logical steps, you can systematically approach the problem and arrive at the solution.",,

This involves summing up the `beat` values from the `Crime` table.  6. **Handle Conditional Aggregation**:    - Use a `CASE` statement within the `SUM` function to ensure that only beats from community areas with a population greater than 50,000 are included in the sum. If the population condition is not met, add 0 to the sum.  7. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Write the SQL query incorporating the above logic:            SELECT 1.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN T1.population > 50000 THEN T2.beat ELSE 0 END) AS sum      FROM Community_Area AS T1      INNER JOIN Crime AS T2 ON T2.community_area_no = T1.community_area_no      WHERE T1.side = 'Central';        8. **Verify the Query**:    - Ensure the query correctly joins the tables, applies the necessary filters, and performs the aggregation as intended.  By following these steps, we arrive at the solution that calculates the total beat of crimes for community areas on the central side with a population of 50,000 and above.",,

Here is a breakdown of the reasoning process:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement:**    - We need to list the case numbers of crimes occurring in wards with a population below 52,000.    - Additionally, these crimes should have a beat number greater than 90% of the average beat of all crimes.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns:**    - From the schema, the relevant tables are `Crime` and `Ward`.    - The `Crime` table contains information about crimes, including `case_number`, `beat`, and `ward_no`.    - The `Ward` table contains information about wards, including `ward_no` and `Population`.  3. **Determine the Conditions for Filtering:**    - We need to filter crimes based on wards with a population less than 52,000. This requires joining the `Crime` table with the `Ward` table on `ward_no`.    - We also need to filter crimes where the `beat` is greater than 90% of the average `beat` for crimes in wards with a population below 52,000.  4. **Calculate the Average Beat:**    - To find the average `beat`, we need to calculate it for all crimes in wards with a population below 52,000.    - This involves using an aggregate function (`AVG`) on the `beat` column after applying the population filter.  5. **Apply the Beat Condition:**    - Once we have the average `beat`, we multiply it by 0.9 to get 90% of the average.    - We then filter the crimes where the `beat` is greater than this calculated value.  6. **Formulate the SQL Query:**    - Start by writing a query to join `Crime` and `Ward` tables on `ward_no`.    - Apply the population filter (`T2.Population < 52000`).    - Use a subquery to calculate 90% of the average `beat` for the filtered crimes.    - Use this subquery result to filter crimes with `beat` greater than the calculated value.    - Finally, select the `case_number` of the crimes that meet these conditions.  7. **Write the SQL Query:**    - The final SQL query is structured as follows:   SELECT T1.case_number FROM Crime AS T1 INNER JOIN Ward AS T2 ON T1.ward_no = T2.ward_no WHERE T2.Population < 52000   AND T1.beat > (     SELECT AVG(T1.beat) * 0.9     FROM Crime AS T1     INNER JOIN Ward AS T2 ON T1.ward_no = T2.ward_no     WHERE T2.Population < 52000   );   By following these logical steps, we can ensure that the query correctly identifies and lists the case numbers of crimes that meet the specified criteria.",,

Here’s how we can approach it:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: We need to find the FBI code and its definition specifically for the crime category ""Gambling.""  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**: From the schema, identify which table contains information about FBI codes and their descriptions. The table `FBI_Code` is relevant as it contains columns like `fbi_code_no`, `title`, and `description`.  3. **Determine the Necessary Columns**: We need the FBI code and its definition. From the `FBI_Code` table, the columns `fbi_code_no` and `description` will provide this information.  4. **Formulate the Query Condition**: We need to filter the records where the `title` matches ""Gambling."" This will allow us to retrieve only the relevant row(s) from the `FBI_Code` table.  5. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Use the `SELECT` statement to specify the columns we are interested in: `fbi_code_no` and `description`.    - Use the `FROM` clause to specify the table: `FBI_Code`.    - Use the `WHERE` clause to filter the results to only include rows where the `title` is ""Gambling.""  6. **Write the SQL Query**: Based on the above steps, the SQL query is:        SELECT fbi_code_no, description FROM FBI_Code WHERE title = 'Gambling';      7. **Verify the Query**: Ensure that the query logically aligns with the problem statement and that it will correctly retrieve the desired information.

Here's how we can approach the problem:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: The task is to find out what percentage of crimes are severe. This requires identifying which crimes are considered severe and then calculating their proportion relative to the total number of crimes.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**: From the schema, we need to identify which tables and columns contain information about crimes and their severity. The `Crime` table contains crime records, and the `IUCR` table contains details about crime types, including the `index_code` which indicates severity.  3. **Determine Criteria for Severe Crimes**: According to the schema, the `IUCR` table has an `index_code` column. Typically, an `index_code` of 'I' indicates an ""Index Crime,"" which is often considered severe. We need to count crimes with this index code.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - **Count Severe Crimes**: Use a `CASE` statement within a `COUNT` function to count only those crimes where `index_code` is 'I'. This helps in filtering and counting only severe crimes.    - **Count Total Crimes**: Count all entries in the `IUCR` table to get the total number of crimes.    - **Calculate Percentage**: Divide the count of severe crimes by the total number of crimes and multiply by 100 to get the percentage.  5. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Use a `SELECT` statement to perform the calculations.    - Use `CAST` to ensure the division results in a real number, allowing for a precise percentage calculation.    - The query should look like this:            SELECT CAST(COUNT(CASE WHEN index_code = 'I' THEN iucr_no ELSE NULL END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(iucr_no) FROM IUCR          - This query counts the number of severe crimes (where `index_code` is 'I') and divides it by the total number of crimes, then multiplies by 100 to get the percentage.  6. **Review and Validate**: Ensure that the query correctly captures the logic of identifying severe crimes and calculating the percentage. Validate against sample data if available to ensure accuracy.  By following these steps, we can logically derive the solution to the problem and construct an SQL query that accurately calculates the percentage of severe crimes.",,

This requires analyzing crime data specific to the Austin district.  2. **Review the Schema**: Examine the schema provided to understand the structure of the tables and the relationships between them. We have tables like `Community_Area`, `District`, `FBI_Code`, `IUCR`, `Neighborhood`, `Ward`, and `Crime`. The `Crime` table contains information about crimes, including the `district_no` and `location_description`.  3. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - The `Crime` table is crucial because it contains crime data, including `location_description`, `district_no`, and `case_number`.    - The `District` table is important to identify the district name corresponding to each `district_no`.  4. **Determine the Relationship**: Establish the relationship between the `Crime` and `District` tables. The `district_no` in the `Crime` table can be used to join with the `district_no` in the `District` table to filter crimes specific to the Austin district.  5. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - **Join the Tables**: Use an INNER JOIN between the `Crime` and `District` tables on `district_no` to link crime records with their respective district names.    - **Filter by District Name**: Use a WHERE clause to filter records where `district_name` is 'Austin'.    - **Group and Count**: Group the results by `location_description` and count the number of crimes for each location type.    - **Order and Limit**: Order the results in descending order based on the count of crimes and limit the result to the top entry to find the location with the most reported crimes.  6. **Write the SQL Query**:        SELECT T2.location_description    FROM District AS T1    INNER JOIN Crime AS T2 ON T2.district_no = T1.district_no    WHERE T1.district_name = 'Austin'    GROUP BY T2.location_description    ORDER BY COUNT(T2.case_number) DESC    LIMIT 1;      7. **Verify the Solution**: Ensure that the query accurately reflects the problem requirements and correctly identifies the location type with the most reported crimes in the Austin district.  By following these steps, we systematically approach the problem, leveraging the schema and relationships between tables to derive the required solution.",,

Here’s a breakdown of how you might approach this problem:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: The task is to find the average number of community areas that exist within each side. This requires calculating the total number of community areas and dividing it by the number of unique sides.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - The `Community_Area` table is relevant because it contains information about community areas and their corresponding sides.    - The `Crime` table is indirectly relevant because it links community areas to wards, which might be necessary for joining tables.    - The `Ward` table is included in the solution, suggesting that it might be used to ensure that only relevant community areas are considered.  3. **Determine Necessary Joins**:    - A join between the `Crime` and `Community_Area` tables is needed to link community areas to sides, using the `community_area_no` column.    - A join between the `Ward` and `Crime` tables is used to filter or aggregate data based on wards, using the `ward_no` column.  4. **Calculate Total Community Areas**:    - Use `COUNT(T1.ward_no)` to count the total number of community areas. This assumes that each ward is associated with a community area, which might be indirectly linked through crimes.  5. **Calculate Unique Sides**:    - Use `COUNT(DISTINCT T3.side)` to determine the number of unique sides. This gives the denominator for the average calculation.  6. **Compute the Average**:    - Divide the total number of community areas by the number of unique sides to get the average. Use `CAST` to ensure the division results in a real number rather than an integer.  7. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Combine these elements into a single SQL query that performs the necessary joins and calculations.  Here is the logical SQL query based on these steps:   SELECT CAST(COUNT(T1.ward_no) AS REAL) / COUNT(DISTINCT T3.side) FROM Ward AS T1 INNER JOIN Crime AS T2 ON T2.ward_no = T1.ward_no INNER JOIN Community_Area AS T3 ON T3.community_area_no = T2.community_area_no   This query calculates the average number of community areas per side by joining the necessary tables and performing the required aggregation and division operations.",,

This requires analyzing crime data and associating it with community areas.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:     - The `Crime` table contains information about crimes, including the `location_description` which specifies where the crime occurred.    - The `Community_Area` table provides details about community areas, including their unique identifiers (`community_area_no`).  3. **Determine Necessary Data**:    - From the `Crime` table, we need the `location_description` to filter crimes that occurred on the street and the `community_area_no` to associate each crime with a community area.    - From the `Community_Area` table, we need the `community_area_no` to identify each community area.  4. **Plan the SQL Query**:    - **Join the Tables**: Use an INNER JOIN to combine the `Crime` and `Community_Area` tables based on the `community_area_no`. This allows us to link each crime to its respective community area.    - **Filter for Street Crimes**: Add a WHERE clause to filter the results to only include crimes where the `location_description` is 'STREET'.    - **Group and Count**: Group the results by `community_area_no` and count the number of crimes for each community area.    - **Order and Limit**: Order the results in descending order based on the count of crimes and use LIMIT 1 to get the community area with the highest count.  5. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Construct the SQL query using the plan:            SELECT T1.community_area_no       FROM Community_Area AS T1       INNER JOIN Crime AS T2       ON T2.community_area_no = T1.community_area_no       WHERE T2.location_description = 'STREET'       GROUP BY T1.community_area_no       ORDER BY COUNT(T2.location_description) DESC       LIMIT 1;        6. **Verify the Solution**:    - Ensure the query logic correctly identifies the community area with the highest number of street crimes.    - Check that the query efficiently retrieves the desired result by using appropriate filtering, grouping, and ordering.  By following these steps, you can logically derive the solution to the problem using SQL.",,

Here’s how you could approach the problem:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: We need to calculate the average number of reckless homicides per district. This involves counting the occurrences of reckless homicides and dividing by the number of districts.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - **Crime Table**: This table contains information about each crime, including the `report_no`, `iucr_no`, and `district_no`.    - **IUCR Table**: This table provides descriptions of crimes, including `iucr_no` and `secondary_description`. We need this to identify reckless homicides.    - **District Table**: This table contains information about districts, including `district_no` and `district_name`.  3. **Determine the Key Relationships**:    - Crimes are linked to districts via the `district_no` column in both the Crime and District tables.    - Crimes are linked to their descriptions via the `iucr_no` column in both the Crime and IUCR tables.  4. **Filter for Reckless Homicides**:    - Use the IUCR table to filter crimes that are classified as ""RECKLESS HOMICIDE"" by checking the `secondary_description` column.  5. **Count the Number of Reckless Homicides**:    - Join the Crime table with the IUCR table to filter for reckless homicides.    - Count the number of records in the Crime table that match the reckless homicide criteria.  6. **Count the Number of Districts**:    - Use the District table to count the number of distinct districts. This is important because we need to divide the total number of reckless homicides by the number of districts to get the average.  7. **Calculate the Average**:    - Divide the total count of reckless homicides by the number of distinct districts to find the average number of reckless homicides per district.  8. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Use SQL to implement the above logic. The query should:      - Join the District and Crime tables on `district_no`.      - Join the result with the IUCR table on `iucr_no`.      - Filter for `secondary_description = 'RECKLESS HOMICIDE'`.      - Count the number of reckless homicides.      - Count the number of distinct districts.      - Divide the total number of reckless homicides by the number of districts to get the average.  Here is the SQL query that implements these steps:   SELECT CAST(COUNT(T2.report_no) AS REAL) / COUNT(DISTINCT T1.district_name) FROM District AS T1 INNER JOIN Crime AS T2 ON T2.district_no = T1.district_no INNER JOIN IUCR AS T3 ON T3.iucr_no = T2.iucr_no WHERE T3.secondary_description = 'RECKLESS HOMICIDE'   This query calculates the average number of reckless homicides per district by dividing the total count of reckless homicides by the number of distinct districts.",,

Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the logical reasoning that could be used to arrive at the solution:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement:**    - We need to identify the ward with the highest number of crimes where no arrest was made.    - Retrieve the address and phone number of the ward office for that particular ward.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns:**    - The `Crime` table contains information about crimes, including whether an arrest was made (`arrest` column) and the ward number (`ward_no` column).    - The `Ward` table contains information about ward offices, including their addresses (`ward_office_address`) and phone numbers (`ward_office_phone`).  3. **Determine the Necessary Join:**    - To link crimes to ward offices, we need to join the `Crime` table and the `Ward` table on the `ward_no` column, as this is the common attribute that connects the two tables.  4. **Filter for Crimes Without Arrest:**    - We are only interested in crimes where no arrest was made. Therefore, we need to filter the `Crime` table records where `arrest` is `FALSE`.  5. **Aggregate and Count Crimes by Ward:**    - We need to count the number of crimes without arrest for each ward. This requires grouping the data by `ward_no` and counting the occurrences.  6. **Order by Crime Count and Limit the Result:**    - To find the ward with the most crimes without arrest, order the results by the count of crimes in descending order.    - Use `LIMIT 1` to select only the ward with the highest count.  7. **Select the Required Columns:**    - Finally, select the `ward_office_address` and `ward_office_phone` from the `Ward` table for the ward identified in the previous step.  8. **Formulate the SQL Query:**    - Combine all the steps into a coherent SQL query:            SELECT T2.ward_office_address, T2.ward_office_phone      FROM Crime AS T1      INNER JOIN Ward AS T2 ON T2.ward_no = T1.ward_no      WHERE T1.arrest = 'FALSE'      GROUP BY T2.ward_office_address, T2.ward_office_phone      ORDER BY COUNT(T1.arrest) DESC      LIMIT 1;        By following these logical steps, we ensure that the query accurately retrieves the desired information about the ward with the most crimes without arrest, along with its office address and phone number.",,

This relationship allows us to join these tables to access the crime descriptions.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Start by selecting the necessary columns: `case_number`, `latitude`, and `longitude` from the `Crime` table.    - Use an `INNER JOIN` to connect the `Crime` table with the `IUCR` table on the `iucr_no` column. This join will allow us to filter crimes based on their descriptions.    - Apply a `WHERE` clause to filter the results to only include rows where the `secondary_description` in the `IUCR` table is 'CHILD ABDUCTION'.  5. **Write the SQL Query**:    - The SQL query is constructed as follows:            SELECT T1.case_number, T1.latitude, T1.longitude      FROM Crime AS T1      INNER JOIN IUCR AS T2 ON T2.iucr_no = T1.iucr_no      WHERE T2.secondary_description = 'CHILD ABDUCTION';        6. **Verify the Query**:    - Ensure that the query correctly joins the tables and filters the results to only include child abduction cases.    - Check that the selected columns (`case_number`, `latitude`, `longitude`) are correctly retrieved from the `Crime` table.  By following these steps, we ensure that the solution is logically derived and addresses the problem statement effectively.",,

Here's how we can approach the problem:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: We need to find the most reported crime in the Northwest side. This requires us to identify crimes associated with community areas located on the Northwest side.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - **Community_Area Table**: This table contains information about community areas, including their location (side). We need this to filter for community areas on the Northwest side.    - **Crime Table**: This table records crime incidents, including the community area number and IUCR code, which links to the type of crime.    - **IUCR Table**: This table provides descriptions of crimes based on IUCR codes. We need this to get the specific crime descriptions.  3. **Determine the Relationships**:    - The `Community_Area` table can be linked to the `Crime` table through the `community_area_no` column.    - The `Crime` table can be linked to the `IUCR` table through the `iucr_no` column.  4. **Formulate the Query**:    - **Join Tables**: Use INNER JOIN to combine the `Community_Area`, `Crime`, and `IUCR` tables based on the relationships identified.    - **Filter for Northwest Side**: Use a WHERE clause to filter records where the `side` column in the `Community_Area` table is 'Northwest'.    - **Group and Count**: Group the results by `secondary_description` from the `IUCR` table and use COUNT to determine the frequency of each crime type.    - **Order and Limit**: Order the results by the count in descending order to find the most frequent crime and use LIMIT 1 to get the top result.  5. **Write the SQL Query**:    - The SQL query should select the `secondary_description` of the most reported crime, joining the necessary tables, applying the filter for the Northwest side, grouping by crime description, ordering by the count of occurrences, and limiting the result to the top one.  By following these steps, we ensure that we correctly identify the most reported crime in the Northwest side using the given schema and data relationships.",,

This involves identifying crimes classified under drug abuse and then determining how many of those involve cannabis.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - **Crime Table**: Contains records of crimes with columns like `iucr_no` and `fbi_code_no` which can be used to classify the type of crime.    - **IUCR Table**: Contains `iucr_no` and descriptions of crimes, including `secondary_description` which may mention cannabis.    - **FBI_Code Table**: Contains `fbi_code_no` and a `title` that can help identify drug abuse crimes.  3. **Determine the Criteria for Drug Abuse Crimes**:    - Use the `FBI_Code` table to filter crimes with the `title` 'Drug Abuse'. This will help isolate the subset of crimes that are related to drug abuse.  4. **Link Tables to Gather Necessary Data**:    - Join the `Crime` table with the `IUCR` table on `iucr_no` to access crime descriptions.    - Join the `Crime` table with the `FBI_Code` table on `fbi_code_no` to filter for drug abuse crimes.  5. **Filter for Cannabis-Related Crimes**:    - Within the subset of drug abuse crimes, use the `secondary_description` from the `IUCR` table to identify records that mention cannabis. This can be done using a condition that checks if `secondary_description` contains the word 'CANNABIS'.  6. **Calculate the Percentage**:    - Count the total number of drug abuse crimes.    - Count the number of drug abuse crimes related to cannabis.    - Calculate the percentage by dividing the number of cannabis-related crimes by the total number of drug abuse crimes and multiplying by 100.  7. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Use a `CASE` statement within a `COUNT` function to count cannabis-related crimes.    - Use a `CAST` function to ensure the division results in a real number for accurate percentage calculation.    - Structure the query to perform the necessary joins and apply the filtering conditions.  8. **Verify and Test the Solution**:    - Ensure the query correctly joins the tables and applies the filters.    - Test the query with sample data to verify the accuracy of the results.  By following these steps, you can systematically approach the problem and derive the required SQL solution.",,

Less severe crimes are indicated by the index code 'N'.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - The `Crime` table contains information about crime reports, including the date of the crime and a reference to the IUCR code.    - The `IUCR` table contains the index code, which indicates the severity of the crime. We need to filter for index code 'N' to identify less severe crimes.  3. **Determine the Date Range**:     - We are interested in crimes that occurred in February 2018. This means filtering the `Crime` table for records where the date falls within this month and year.  4. **Join Tables**:    - To filter crimes by severity, join the `Crime` table with the `IUCR` table on the `iucr_no` column. This allows us to access the `index_code` from the `IUCR` table for each crime.  5. **Filter for Less Severe Crimes**:    - Use the `WHERE` clause to filter the joined dataset for crimes that occurred in February 2018 and have an `index_code` of 'N'.  6. **Count the Number of Crimes**:    - Count the number of crime reports that meet the criteria using the `COUNT` function on a unique identifier such as `case_number`.  7. **Calculate the Average**:    - Since February typically has 28 days, divide the total count of less severe crimes by 28 to find the average number of such crimes reported per day.  8. **SQL Query Construction**:    - Construct the SQL query using the `SELECT`, `FROM`, `INNER JOIN`, `WHERE`, and `COUNT` clauses. Ensure the date filter is correctly applied using a pattern match (e.g., `LIKE '2/%/2018%'`).  9. **Result Interpretation**:    - The result of the query will be the average number of less severe crimes reported per day in February 2018.  By following these steps, you can logically derive the SQL query needed to solve the problem. The final SQL query is:   SELECT CAST(COUNT(T2.case_number) AS REAL) / 28  FROM IUCR AS T1  INNER JOIN Crime AS T2 ON T2.iucr_no = T1.iucr_no  WHERE T2.date LIKE '2/%/2018%'  AND T1.index_code = 'N'",,

The task is to list the name and population of communities where more than the average number of solicitations for prostitutes were reported. Here’s a breakdown of the reasoning steps:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to find communities with a higher-than-average number of reports for the crime ""solicit for prostitute.""    - The output should include the community name and population.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - **Community_Area**: Contains `community_area_name` and `population`, which are required in the output.    - **Crime**: Contains `community_area_no` and `iucr_no`, which link crimes to community areas.    - **IUCR**: Contains `iucr_no` and `secondary_description`, which describe the type of crime.  3. **Determine the Average Number of Solicitations**:    - Use the `IUCR` table to filter records where `secondary_description` is ""SOLICIT FOR PROSTITUTE.""    - Calculate the average number of such crimes. This involves counting the occurrences of ""SOLICIT FOR PROSTITUTE"" and dividing by the total number of IUCR records.  4. **Filter Crimes Above the Average**:    - Use a subquery to select `iucr_no` values where the count of ""SOLICIT FOR PROSTITUTE"" is greater than the calculated average.  5. **Join Tables to Gather Required Information**:    - Join the `Crime` table with the `Community_Area` table using `community_area_no` to get community names and populations.    - Join the `Crime` table with the `IUCR` table to filter crimes by `iucr_no`.  6. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Use an INNER JOIN to combine the `Crime`, `Community_Area`, and `IUCR` tables.    - Apply the condition to filter crimes with `iucr_no` that match the subquery result (i.e., those with more than the average number of solicitations).    - Select the `community_area_name` and `population` from the `Community_Area` table.  7. **Test and Validate the Query**:    - Ensure the query correctly identifies communities with more than the average number of solicitations.    - Validate the output by checking if the community names and populations are correctly listed.

We need this to filter incidents reported in the ""Harrison"" district.    - **Crime Table:** Contains incident reports, including district numbers and FBI codes, which are crucial for identifying and counting incidents.    - **FBI_Code Table:** Contains FBI code numbers and their corresponding titles, which will help us identify incidents classified as ""Disorderly Conduct.""  3. **Determine the Relationships Between Tables:**    - The `Crime` table can be linked to the `District` table using the `district_no` column.    - The `Crime` table can also be linked to the `FBI_Code` table using the `fbi_code_no` column.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query:**    - **Join the Tables:**      - Join the `Crime` table with the `District` table on `district_no` to filter incidents in the ""Harrison"" district.      - Join the resulting table with the `FBI_Code` table on `fbi_code_no` to access the title of each incident.     - **Filter for ""Harrison"" District:**      - Use a `WHERE` clause to filter records where `district_name` is ""Harrison.""     - **Count Total Incidents in Harrison:**      - Use `COUNT(T2.report_no)` to count all incidents reported in the ""Harrison"" district.     - **Count Disorderly Conduct Incidents:**      - Use `COUNT(CASE WHEN T3.title = 'Disorderly Conduct' THEN T2.report_no END)` to count incidents specifically classified as ""Disorderly Conduct.""     - **Calculate the Percentage:**      - Divide the count of disorderly conduct incidents by the total number of incidents in Harrison and multiply by 100 to get the percentage.  5. **Write the SQL Query:**    - Combine all the steps into a single SQL query:            SELECT COUNT(CASE WHEN T3.title = 'Disorderly Conduct' THEN T2.report_no END) * 100.0 / COUNT(T2.report_no) AS per      FROM District AS T1      INNER JOIN Crime AS T2 ON T2.district_no = T1.district_no      INNER JOIN FBI_Code AS T3 ON T3.fbi_code_no = T2.fbi_code_no      WHERE T1.district_name = 'Harrison'        6. **Verify the Query:**    - Ensure the query correctly joins the tables and applies the necessary filters and calculations to produce the desired result.  By following these logical steps, we can systematically approach the problem and construct a query that accurately calculates the percentage of disorderly conduct incidents in the Harrison district.",,

This can be done using the `COUNT(*)` function in SQL.  5. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Using the `SELECT` statement, we can write the query to count the number of rows where the `longitude` is `-87.72658001`.  6. **Verify the Longitude Format**:    - Ensure that the longitude value is correctly formatted as a string or a numeric value, depending on how it is stored in the database. In this case, it is provided as a string.  7. **Execute the Query**:    - Run the query to get the result, which will give us the count of crimes that occurred at the specified longitude.

This implies that we are interested in crimes related to narcotics.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns:**    - From the schema provided, the `Crime` table contains information about crimes, including a column `iucr_no` which seems to be a code related to the crime type.    - The `IUCR` table contains columns `iucr_no`, `primary_description`, and `secondary_description`. The `primary_description` column likely categorizes the general type of crime (e.g., ""NARCOTICS""), while `secondary_description` provides more specific details.  3. **Determine the Relationship Between Tables:**    - The `Crime` table and the `IUCR` table are related through the `iucr_no` column. This relationship allows us to identify the type of crime based on the `IUCR` table's descriptions.  4. **Formulate the Query:**    - Since we need to list all narcotic-related crimes, we should focus on the `IUCR` table where `primary_description` is ""NARCOTICS"".    - We are interested in the specific types of narcotic crimes, which are detailed in the `secondary_description` column.  5. **Write the SQL Query:**    - We select the `secondary_description` from the `IUCR` table where `primary_description` is ""NARCOTICS"".    - Use `GROUP BY` to ensure that each type of narcotic crime is listed uniquely.  6. **Review and Optimize:**    - Ensure that the query correctly identifies and lists all unique narcotic crime types.    - Verify that the query does not include any unnecessary columns or conditions.  The final SQL query is:  SELECT secondary_description FROM IUCR WHERE primary_description = 'NARCOTICS' GROUP BY secondary_description;   This query effectively lists all unique types of narcotic crimes by leveraging the `IUCR` table's `secondary_description` field, filtered by the `primary_description` being ""NARCOTICS"".",,

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - The task is to list crimes classified by the FBI as ""Drug Abuse"" using their report numbers.  2. **Analyze the Schema**:    - We have several tables, but the relevant ones for this problem are likely the `FBI_Code` and `Crime` tables.    - The `FBI_Code` table contains information about different crime classifications, including a `title` column that might contain ""Drug Abuse"".    - The `Crime` table contains crime details, including a `report_no` and an `fbi_code_no` that links to the `FBI_Code` table.  3. **Identify the Relevant Columns**:    - From `FBI_Code`, we need the `title` column to filter for ""Drug Abuse"".    - From `Crime`, we need the `report_no` column to list the report numbers of the relevant crimes.  4. **Determine the Relationship Between Tables**:    - The `Crime` table has a foreign key `fbi_code_no` that links to the `fbi_code_no` in the `FBI_Code` table. This relationship allows us to join these tables.  5. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - We need to perform an INNER JOIN between the `FBI_Code` and `Crime` tables on the `fbi_code_no` column to combine the relevant data.    - Use a WHERE clause to filter the joined data where the `title` in `FBI_Code` is ""Drug Abuse"".  6. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Start with the SELECT statement to choose the `report_no` from the `Crime` table.    - Use an INNER JOIN to connect `Crime` and `FBI_Code` on `fbi_code_no`.    - Apply a WHERE clause to filter for `title = 'Drug Abuse'`.  7. **Verify the Solution**:    - Ensure that the query correctly retrieves the report numbers of crimes classified as ""Drug Abuse"" by the FBI.  The final SQL query is:  SELECT T2.report_no  FROM FBI_Code AS T1  INNER JOIN Crime AS T2  ON T2.fbi_code_no = T1.fbi_code_no  WHERE T1.title = 'Drug Abuse';   By following these logical steps, we ensure that the query is constructed correctly and efficiently retrieves the desired information.",,

The final SQL query is:  SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN T3.district_name = 'Calumet' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) FROM IUCR AS T1 INNER JOIN Crime AS T2 ON T2.iucr_no = T1.iucr_no INNER JOIN District AS T3 ON T3.district_no = T2.district_no WHERE T1.primary_description = 'WEAPONS VIOLATION'   This query effectively counts the number of weapons violation crimes that occurred in the Calumet district by leveraging the relationships between the `Crime`, `IUCR`, and `District` tables.",,

Here’s how we can approach the problem:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: We need to identify the exact locations (latitude and longitude) of crimes that occurred specifically in the Belmont Cragin community.  2. **Review the Schema**: Examine the provided schema to understand the structure of the tables and the relationships between them. The relevant tables for this problem are `Community_Area` and `Crime`.  3. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - **Community_Area Table**: This table contains information about different community areas, including their names and numbers. We need this to identify the community area number for Belmont Cragin.    - **Crime Table**: This table contains crime records, including the community area number, latitude, and longitude, which are crucial for identifying the location of crimes.  4. **Determine the Relationship**: The `Crime` table has a `community_area_no` column that can be linked to the `community_area_no` column in the `Community_Area` table. This relationship allows us to filter crimes by community area.  5. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - **Select Clause**: We need to select the `latitude` and `longitude` from the `Crime` table to get the exact locations of the crimes.    - **Join Clause**: Use an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Community_Area` and `Crime` tables based on the `community_area_no` column. This allows us to filter crimes by community area.    - **Where Clause**: Filter the results to only include crimes that occurred in Belmont Cragin by specifying `WHERE T1.community_area_name = 'Belmont Cragin'`.    - **Group By Clause**: Use `GROUP BY` to ensure that the results are distinct, as multiple crimes could occur at the same location.  6. **Write the SQL Query**:    - The query is structured to join the `Community_Area` table (aliased as `T1`) with the `Crime` table (aliased as `T2`), filter for Belmont Cragin, and select distinct latitude and longitude values.  7. **Verify the Query**: Ensure that the query logic correctly captures the requirement to find crime locations in Belmont Cragin and that it uses the correct columns and tables.  By following these steps, we can construct the SQL query that retrieves the exact locations of crimes in the Belmont Cragin community.",,

Pontecore Jr.',"To solve the problem of determining how many domestic crime cases Commander Ronald A. Pontecore Jr. has been responsible for investigating, we can follow these logical steps:  1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to find the number of domestic crime cases associated with a specific commander, Ronald A. Pontecore Jr. This requires us to identify the relevant data tables and columns that can provide this information.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**: From the schema provided, the relevant tables are:    - `District`: Contains information about each district, including the commander.    - `Crime`: Contains information about each crime, including whether it was domestic and the district number.  3. **Determine the Relationship Between Tables**: We need to connect the `District` and `Crime` tables. The common column between these two tables is `district_no`, which allows us to join the tables.  4. **Filter for the Specific Commander**: In the `District` table, filter the records where the `commander` column matches 'Ronald A. Pontecore Jr.'. This will give us the districts under his command.  5. **Join Tables**: Perform an inner join between the `District` table and the `Crime` table using the `district_no` column. This will associate each crime with the corresponding district and its commander.  6. **Identify Domestic Crimes**: In the `Crime` table, the `domestic` column indicates whether a crime is domestic. We need to count only those crimes where `domestic` is 'TRUE'.  7. **Count Domestic Crimes**: Use a conditional aggregation to count the number of domestic crimes. This can be done using a `CASE` statement within a `SUM` function to count only the records where `domestic` is 'TRUE'.  8. **Write the SQL Query**: Combine all these steps into a single SQL query:        SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN T2.domestic = 'TRUE' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)    FROM District AS T1    INNER JOIN Crime AS T2 ON T2.district_no = T1.district_no    WHERE T1.commander = 'Ronald A. Pontecore Jr.';      9. **Verify the Solution**: Ensure that the query correctly counts only the domestic crimes for the specified commander by checking the logic and the join condition.  By following these steps, we can accurately determine the number of domestic crime cases that Commander Ronald A. Pontecore Jr. has been responsible for investigating.",,
