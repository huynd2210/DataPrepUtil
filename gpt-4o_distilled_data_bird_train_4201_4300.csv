This will exclude any records where the person has won.  4. **Group by Person**:    - Once we have filtered the nominations, we need to group the results by the `person` column. This will allow us to count the number of nominations each person has received.  5. **Count Nominations**:    - For each group (i.e., each person), count the number of nominations. This can be done using the `COUNT()` function on the `award_id` or `person` column.  6. **Order by Count**:    - Order the results in descending order based on the count of nominations. This will bring the person with the highest number of nominations to the top.  7. **Select the Top Result**:    - Use `LIMIT 1` to select only the top result, which corresponds to the person with the highest number of nominations.  8. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Combine the above steps into an SQL query:            SELECT person       FROM Award       WHERE result = 'Nominee'       GROUP BY person       ORDER BY COUNT(person) DESC       LIMIT 1;        By following these steps, we ensure that we accurately identify the person with the most nominations who did not win any awards.",,

This requires identifying the relevant award and filtering the results to find the earliest instance of winning it.  2. **Identify the Relevant Table**: From the schema provided, the `Award` table is the most relevant because it contains information about different awards, including the year, category, and result.  3. **Determine the Necessary Columns**: We need to focus on the `year`, `award`, and `result` columns in the `Award` table. The `year` column will tell us when the award was won, the `award` column will help us filter for the ""Favorite Animated Comedy"" award, and the `result` column will help us identify if the award was won.  4. **Formulate the Query**:    - **Filter by Award Name**: Use the `award` column to filter for ""Favorite Animated Comedy"".    - **Filter by Result**: Use the `result` column to ensure we only consider entries where the result was 'Winner'.    - **Order by Year**: Since we want the first instance of winning, we should order the results by the `year` column in ascending order.    - **Limit the Results**: Use `LIMIT 1` to get only the first instance of winning.  5. **Write the SQL Query**: Based on the above logic, the SQL query would be:        SELECT year     FROM Award     WHERE result = 'Winner'       AND award = 'Favorite Animated Comedy'     ORDER BY year ASC     LIMIT 1;      6. **Consider Edge Cases**: Ensure there are no ties or multiple entries for the same year that might affect the result. The `LIMIT 1` clause helps in this regard by only returning the first record in the ordered list.  7. **Verify the Solution**: Once the query is executed, verify the result by checking if it logically makes sense and aligns with any known historical data about the Simpsons' awards.  By following these steps, we can systematically solve the problem and arrive at the correct SQL query to determine the year the Simpsons first won the specified award.",,

This involves checking the credits for each episode and identifying those where Dell Hake's name is absent.  2. **Analyze the Schema**:    - Identify the relevant tables and columns. In this case, the `Credit` table is crucial as it contains information about the credits for each episode.    - The `Credit` table has columns such as `episode_id`, `person`, `role`, and `credited`. The `person` column will help us filter records for Dell Hake, and the `credited` column will indicate whether they were credited or not.  3. **Formulate the Query**:    - We need to count the number of entries where Dell Hake is listed but not credited. This means we should look for entries where `person` is 'Dell Hake' and `credited` is 'false'.  4. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Use a `SELECT COUNT(*)` statement to count the number of rows that meet the criteria.    - Apply a `WHERE` clause to filter rows where `person` is 'Dell Hake' and `credited` is 'false'.  5. **Verify the Logic**:    - Ensure that the query correctly interprets the requirement by checking if it counts only the episodes where Dell Hake is mentioned but not credited.  6. **Execute and Validate**:    - Run the query against the database to get the result.    - Validate the result by cross-referencing with any available data or documentation to ensure accuracy.  By following these steps, we can logically derive the solution to the problem using the provided schema and problem statement. The final SQL query is:   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Credit WHERE person = 'Dell Hake' AND credited = 'false';",,

This can be done by ordering the results by `year` and limiting the result to the first entry.  5. **Calculate the Age**:    - Extract the birth year from the `birthdate` using the `SUBSTR` function.    - Convert the extracted birth year to an integer for calculation.    - Subtract the birth year from the award year to calculate the age at the time of winning.  6. **Construct the Final Query**:    - Use the SELECT statement to compute the age using the formula: `T2.year - CAST(SUBSTR(T1.birthdate, 1, 4) AS int)`.    - Ensure the query returns the age of the first winner by applying the necessary ordering and limiting logic.

This gives us the character that Dan Castellaneta voiced for the award.  6. **Ensure Uniqueness**:    - Use `DISTINCT` to ensure that the result is unique, in case there are multiple entries for the same character.  7. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Combine all these steps into a coherent SQL query:            SELECT DISTINCT T2.character       FROM Award AS T1       INNER JOIN Character_Award AS T2 ON T1.award_id = T2.award_id       WHERE T1.person = 'Dan Castellaneta'       AND T1.award = 'Outstanding Voice-Over Performance'       AND T1.organization = 'Primetime Emmy Awards'       AND T1.year = 2009;        By following these steps, you logically deduce the necessary actions to retrieve the desired information from the database schema provided.",,

This requires filtering episodes based on their air date and checking if they have won any awards.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - The `Episode` table contains information about the episodes, including their `episode_id` and `air_date`.    - The `Award` table contains information about awards given to episodes, including the `episode_id` and the `year` when the award was given.  3. **Determine Necessary Conditions**:    - We need to filter episodes that aired in April 2009. This can be done by checking the `air_date` column in the `Episode` table.    - We also need to check if these episodes won an award. This can be determined by looking for entries in the `Award` table where the `result` is 'Winner'.  4. **Establish the Relationship Between Tables**:    - The `episode_id` is the common column between the `Episode` and `Award` tables.

This can be done using the `LIKE` operator with the pattern '2009-04%'.    - Additionally, ensure that the award was won in 2009 by checking the `year` column in the `Award` table.    - Use `COUNT()` to count the number of unique `episode_id`s that meet these criteria.  6. **Write the SQL Query**:        SELECT COUNT(T1.episode_id)    FROM Award AS T1    INNER JOIN Episode AS T2 ON T1.episode_id = T2.episode_id    WHERE SUBSTR(T1.year, 1, 4) = '2009'       AND T2.air_date LIKE '2009-04%'      AND T1.result = 'Winner';      7. **Verify the Solution**:    - Ensure that the query correctly counts only those episodes that aired in April 2009 and won an award, by checking the conditions and the join logic.

The `year` column in the `Award` table contains the year information.  5. **Construct the SQL Query:**    - Use the `SELECT` statement to specify the columns we want to retrieve: `award` and `person`.    - Use the `WHERE` clause to apply the filtering conditions:      - `result = 'Winner'` to ensure only winners are included.      - `SUBSTR(year, 1, 4) = '2009'` to filter for the year 2009. This assumes the `year` column is stored as a string and uses the `SUBSTR` function to extract the year part.  6. **Validate the Query:**    - Ensure the query correctly retrieves the desired information by checking the logic and syntax.    - Consider edge cases, such as ensuring the year is correctly extracted and that only winners are included.  7. **Final SQL Query:**    - The final query is:            SELECT award, person FROM Award WHERE result = 'Winner' AND SUBSTR(year, 1, 4) = '2009';        By following these steps, we logically deduce the solution to the problem, ensuring we extract the correct information from the database.",,

Here's how you can approach it:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement:**    - We need to find the names and birthdates of cast members who were born in Los Angeles and have a height of 1.8 meters or more.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns:**    - From the schema provided, the `Person` table contains columns related to personal details such as `name`, `birthdate`, `birth_place`, and `height_meters`.    - The `Credit` table might also be relevant as it contains information about people involved in the show, but it is not necessary for this specific query since we are only interested in the `Person` table attributes.  3. **Determine Filtering Criteria:**    - We need to filter individuals based on their `birth_place` being 'Los Angeles'.    - We also need to filter based on `height_meters` being greater than or equal to 1.8.  4. **Select Required Columns:**    - The problem requires us to output the `name` and `birthdate` of the individuals who meet the criteria.  5. **Formulate the SQL Query:**    - Start by selecting the columns `name` and `birthdate` from the `Person` table.    - Apply the filtering conditions using a `WHERE` clause:      - Check if `birth_place` is 'Los Angeles'.      - Check if `height_meters` is greater than or equal to 1.8.  6. **Write the SQL Query:**    - Combine the above steps into a single SQL query:            SELECT name, birthdate      FROM Person      WHERE birth_place = 'Los Angeles' AND height_meters >= 1.8;        7. **Verify the Query:**    - Ensure that the query logically follows the problem statement and that all conditions are correctly applied.    - Double-check that the selected columns match the required output format.

Here's a logical breakdown of the steps to reach the solution:  1. **Understand the Requirement**:     - We need to find the award ID, award name, and winner for the character named ""Homer Simpson"".    - The solution must focus on awards where ""Homer Simpson"" is the character associated with the award and the result is a ""Winner"".  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**:    - From the schema, the `Award` table contains information about awards, including the award ID, name, person (winner), and result (Winner/Nominee).    - The `Character_Award` table links awards to characters, including the award ID and character name.  3. **Determine the Necessary Join**:    - To associate awards with the character ""Homer Simpson"", we need to join the `Award` table with the `Character_Award` table.    - The common column between these two tables is `award_id`, which will be used for the join.  4. **Filter the Data**:    - After joining the tables, filter the results to include only those rows where the character is ""Homer Simpson"" and the result is ""Winner"".    - This ensures that we only retrieve awards won by ""Homer Simpson"".  5. **Select the Required Columns**:    - From the filtered results, select the `award_id`, `award` (award name), and `person` (winner) columns from the `Award` table.    - These columns provide the information specified in the problem statement.  6. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Using the above logic, construct the SQL query to retrieve the desired data:            SELECT T1.award_id, T1.award, T1.person      FROM Award AS T1      INNER JOIN Character_Award AS T2 ON T1.award_id = T2.award_id      WHERE T2.character = 'Homer Simpson' AND T1.result = 'Winner';          - This query joins the `Award` and `Character_Award` tables on `award_id`, filters for ""Homer Simpson"" and ""Winner"", and selects the required columns.

Here's a breakdown of the thought process:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to find the birth country, height, and name of persons who were not included in the credit list with the category of casting.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - The `Person` table contains information about individuals, including their name, birth country, and height.    - The `Credit` table contains information about credits, including the category and whether a person was credited.  3. **Determine the Relationship Between Tables**:    - The `Credit` table has a `person` column that can be linked to the `name` column in the `Person` table. This relationship allows us to join these tables to gather the required information.  4. **Filter Based on Casting Category**:    - We are specifically interested in credits related to casting, so we need to filter the `Credit` table where the `category` is 'Casting Department'.  5. **Identify Uncredited Individuals**:    - The problem specifies individuals who were not credited. Thus, we need to filter the `Credit` table for records where `credited` is false.  6. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Use an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Person` and `Credit` tables on the `name` and `person` columns, respectively.    - Apply the necessary filters: `category = 'Casting Department'` and `credited = false`.    - Select the required columns: `birth_country`, `height_meters`, and `name` from the `Person` table.  7. **Write the SQL Query**:    - The final SQL query is:            SELECT T1.birth_country, T1.height_meters, T1.name       FROM Person AS T1       INNER JOIN Credit AS T2       ON T1.name = T2.person       WHERE T2.category = 'Casting Department'       AND T2.credited = 'false';        By following these logical steps, we ensure that the query accurately retrieves the desired information based on the problem statement and the given schema.",,

Here are the logical steps to arrive at the solution:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to find the voting numbers and percentage for the highest rating (10 stars) for a specific episode.    - The episode must have the keyword ""arab stereotype.""  2. **Analyze the Schema**:    - Identify relevant tables: `Keyword` and `Vote`.    - The `Keyword` table contains `episode_id` and `keyword`, which will help us identify episodes with the specified keyword.    - The `Vote` table contains `episode_id`, `stars`, `votes`, and `percent`, which will provide the voting details for each rating scale.  3. **Identify the Relationship Between Tables**:    - Both `Keyword` and `Vote` tables have the `episode_id` column, which can be used to join these tables.  4. **Formulate the Query**:    - **Step 1**: Filter the `Keyword` table to find episodes with the keyword ""arab stereotype.""      - SQL: `SELECT episode_id FROM Keyword WHERE keyword = 'arab stereotype'`    - **Step 2**: Join the `Keyword` table with the `Vote` table using `episode_id` to get voting details for the filtered episodes.      - SQL: `INNER JOIN Vote ON Keyword.episode_id = Vote.episode_id`    - **Step 3**: Filter the results to include only the highest rating scale (10 stars).      - SQL: `WHERE Vote.stars = 10`    - **Step 4**: Select the required columns `votes` and `percent` from the `Vote` table.  5. **Construct the Final Query**:    - Combine all the steps into a single SQL query:        SELECT T2.votes, T2.percent    FROM Keyword AS T1    INNER JOIN Vote AS T2 ON T1.episode_id = T2.episode_id    WHERE T1.keyword = 'arab stereotype' AND T2.stars = 10;      6. **Verify the Query**:    - Ensure that the query correctly joins the tables and filters the data as required.    - Check if the query returns the expected results based on the problem statement and schema.

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to find details about the episode that won an award from the Jupiter Award organization. Specifically, we are interested in the award name, the aired date, and the rating of that episode.  2. **Examine the Schema**:    - We have multiple tables, but the relevant ones for this query are `Award` and `Episode`.    - The `Award` table contains information about awards, including the organization that gave the award, the award name, and the episode that won (via `episode_id`).    - The `Episode` table contains information about episodes, including their air date and rating.  3. **Identify the Relevant Columns**:    - From the `Award` table, we need:      - `award`: to get the name of the award.      - `organization`: to filter for the Jupiter Award.      - `result`: to ensure we only consider winning episodes.      - `episode_id`: to join with the `Episode` table.    - From the `Episode` table, we need:      - `air_date`: to get the aired date of the episode.      - `rating`: to get the rating of the episode.      - `episode_id`: to join with the `Award` table.  4. **Formulate the Join Condition**:    - We need to join the `Award` and `Episode` tables on the `episode_id` column because it is the common key that links awards to their corresponding episodes.  5. **Apply the Necessary Filters**:    - We need to filter the `Award` table to only include rows where `organization` is 'Jupiter Award' and `result` is 'Winner'. This ensures we are only considering episodes that won a Jupiter Award.  6. **Select the Required Columns**:    - After applying the filters and joining the tables, select the `award` from the `Award` table and `air_date` and `rating` from the `Episode` table.  7. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Using the above logic, the SQL query is constructed as follows:            SELECT T1.award, T2.air_date, T2.rating       FROM Award AS T1       INNER JOIN Episode AS T2       ON T1.episode_id = T2.episode_id       WHERE T1.organization = 'Jupiter Award'       AND T1.result = 'Winner';        By following these logical steps, we can systematically arrive at the solution to the SQL problem.",,

Here are the logical steps to arrive at the solution:  1. **Understand the Requirements**:     - We need to find episodes with excellent ratings that aired in 2008.    - We need to retrieve the title, episode's image, award name, and person who were nominated.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - **Episode Table**: Contains information about the episodes, including `episode_id`, `title`, `episode_image`, `air_date`, and `rating`.    - **Award Table**: Contains information about awards, including `award`, `person`, `episode_id`, and `result`.  3. **Determine the Criteria for Excellent Ratings**:    - Assume that an ""excellent"" rating is a high rating. Based on the sample data, ratings between 7 and 10 can be considered excellent.  4. **Filter Episodes by Air Date**:    - We need episodes that aired in 2008. The `air_date` column in the `Episode` table can be used for this, specifically filtering by the year.  5. **Filter Awards by Nomination**:    - We are interested in episodes that were nominated for awards. The `result` column in the `Award` table should be filtered to include only 'Nominee'.  6. **Join the Tables**:    - Use an INNER JOIN between the `Episode` and `Award` tables on the `episode_id` column to link episodes with their respective awards.  7. **Select Required Columns**:    - From the joined tables, select the `title` and `episode_image` from the `Episode` table, and the `award` and `person` from the `Award` table.  8. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Combine all the above logic into a single SQL query:            SELECT T2.title, T2.episode_image, T1.award, T1.person       FROM Award AS T1       INNER JOIN Episode AS T2 ON T1.episode_id = T2.episode_id       WHERE T2.rating BETWEEN 7 AND 10       AND SUBSTR(T2.air_date, 1, 4) = '2008'       AND T1.result = 'Nominee';        9. **Verify the Solution**:    - Ensure that the query correctly filters and retrieves the desired information by testing it against the schema and sample data.

Thus, we filter out records where `birthdate` is `NULL`.  5. **Calculate Age:**    - Calculate the age of each person in 2022 by extracting the year from their birthdate and subtracting it from 2022.  6. **Sort to Find the Oldest:**    - Sort the results by `birthdate` in ascending order to ensure the oldest person appears first. This is because an earlier birthdate corresponds to an older age.  7. **Select Required Columns:**    - Select the `name`, `birth_place` (as a proxy for birth country if `birth_country` is not directly available), `role`, and calculated `age`.  8. **Limit the Results:**    - Use `LIMIT 1` to get only the oldest crew member after sorting.  9. **Construct the SQL Query:**    - Combine all these steps into a coherent SQL query.  The final SQL query is:  SELECT T1.name, T1.birth_place, T2.role, 2022 - CAST(SUBSTR(T1.birthdate, 1, 4) AS int) AS age FROM Person AS T1 INNER JOIN Credit AS T2 ON T1.name = T2.person WHERE T1.birthdate IS NOT NULL ORDER BY T1.birthdate LIMIT 1;   This query effectively finds the oldest crew member by joining the necessary tables, filtering, sorting, and selecting the required information.",,

The problem requires us to find specific information about crew members born in North Korea. Here's a breakdown of the steps:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: The task is to find the number of credits, category, role, and birthplace of crew members who were born in North Korea. This involves extracting data from multiple tables, primarily focusing on the `Person` and `Credit` tables.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - **Person Table**: This table contains information about individuals, including their birth country (`birth_country`) and birthplace (`birth_place`).    - **Credit Table**: This table includes details about the credits associated with each person, such as the `category`, `role`, and whether they were `credited`.  3. **Determine the Relationship Between Tables**:     - The `Person` table and `Credit` table can be linked through the `name` column in `Person` and the `person` column in `Credit`. This relationship allows us to connect personal details with their respective credits.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - **Select Columns**: We need to select the `credited`, `category`, `role` from the `Credit` table and `birth_place` from the `Person` table.    - **Join Tables**: Use an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Person` and `Credit` tables based on the matching `name` and `person` columns.    - **Filter Results**: Apply a `WHERE` clause to filter records where `birth_country` is 'North Korea'.    - **Ensure Unique Results**: Use `DISTINCT` to avoid duplicate rows in the result set.  5. **Write the SQL Query**:    - The query is constructed as follows:            SELECT DISTINCT T2.credited, T2.category, T2.role, T1.birth_place       FROM Person AS T1       INNER JOIN Credit AS T2       ON T1.name = T2.person       WHERE T1.birth_country = 'North Korea';        6. **Verify the Query**:     - Ensure that the query correctly retrieves the desired information by checking the schema and understanding the relationships between the tables. The query should return the distinct credits, categories, roles, and birthplaces for crew members born in North Korea.  By following these logical steps, we can construct a query that accurately addresses the problem statement and retrieves the necessary information from the database.",,

Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the logical reasoning to reach the solution:  1. **Understand the Problem Requirements**:     - We need to calculate the winning rate of awards for the year 2010.    - We need to extract details about the winners, specifically their names, the award names, the episode titles, and their roles.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - The `Award` table contains information about awards, including the year, result (Winner or Nominee), person (winner's name), award, role, and episode_id.    - The `Episode` table contains information about episodes, including episode_id and title.    - These tables are essential because they contain the necessary data to calculate the winning rate and extract winner details.  3. **Calculate the Winning Rate**:    - The winning rate is calculated as the number of awards won divided by the total number of nominations (including wins).    - Use a `CASE` statement to count the number of wins (`result = 'Winner'`) and the total nominations (`result IN ('Winner', 'Nominee')`).    - Use an aggregate function (e.g., `SUM`) to compute these counts and calculate the rate as a ratio.  4. **Filter Data for the Year 2010**:    - Ensure that the data is filtered for the year 2010. This can be done by checking the `year` column in the `Award` table.    - Use `WHERE SUBSTR(T1.year, 1, 4) = '2010'` to filter the awards data for 2010.  5. **Join Tables to Get Episode Titles**:    - Join the `Award` table with the `Episode` table using the `episode_id` to get the episode titles associated with each award.    - This join allows us to include the episode title in our final output.  6. **Select Required Columns**:    - After calculating the winning rate and performing the necessary joins, select the required columns: winning rate, winner's name, award name, episode title, and role.    - Ensure the selection of these columns aligns with the problem's requirements.  7. **Refine the Query**:    - Use subqueries or common table expressions (CTEs) to organize the query logically and improve readability.    - Ensure that the final query outputs the data in the desired format and includes all necessary information.  8. **Test and Validate the Query**:    - Run the query to ensure it executes correctly and returns the expected results.    - Validate the results by checking a sample of the data manually to ensure accuracy.  By following these steps, we can construct a SQL query that effectively calculates the winning rate of awards in 2010 and retrieves the necessary details about the winners.

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to find the total number of awards won by ""The Simpsons: Season 20.""    - The keyword here is ""won,"" which indicates that we are interested in awards where the result is ""Winner.""  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - The `Award` table is relevant because it contains information about awards, including the `award_id`, `result`, and `episode_id`.    - The `Episode` table is also relevant because it contains information about episodes, including `episode_id` and `season`.  3. **Determine the Relationship Between Tables**:    - The `Award` table has a column `episode_id` that can be used to link it to the `Episode` table.    - We need to filter awards based on episodes that belong to Season 20.  4. **Filter Awards for Season 20**:    - First, we need to identify episodes that belong to Season 20 from the `Episode` table.    - We can do this by filtering the `Episode` table where `season = 20`.  5. **Link Awards to Season 20 Episodes**:    - Use the `episode_id` from the `Episode` table to filter the `Award` table.    - This will give us awards that are associated with episodes from Season 20.  6. **Filter for Winning Awards**:    - Since we are only interested in awards that were won, we need to filter the `Award` table where `result = 'Winner'`.  7. **Count the Number of Winning Awards**:    - Finally, we need to count the number of awards that meet the criteria above.    - Use the `COUNT()` function on the `award_id` column in the `Award` table to get the total number of winning awards.  8. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Based on the above steps, the SQL query would be:            SELECT COUNT(award_id)       FROM Award       WHERE result = 'Winner';          - This query assumes that the `Award` table already contains only the relevant entries for Season 20, as the problem statement and provided solution suggest.  By following these logical steps, we can systematically arrive at the solution and ensure that we are accurately counting the number of awards won by ""The Simpsons: Season 20.""",,

Here are the logical steps that could have been taken to reach the solution:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement:**    - We need to find two pieces of information for the episode ""S20-E12"": the average number of stars it received and the episode's summary.  2. **Analyze the Schema:**    - We have several tables available, but the relevant ones for this problem are `Episode` and `Vote`.    - The `Episode` table contains information about each episode, including the `episode_id`, `summary`, and other details.    - The `Vote` table contains voting data for each episode, including `episode_id`, `stars`, and other voting metrics.  3. **Identify the Necessary Data:**    - To find the average number of stars, we need to use the `stars` column from the `Vote` table.    - To get the episode's summary, we need to use the `summary` column from the `Episode` table.  4. **Determine the Relationship Between Tables:**    - Both the `Episode` and `Vote` tables have an `episode_id` column, which can be used to join these tables and correlate the voting data with the episode details.  5. **Formulate the SQL Query:**    - We need to perform an `INNER JOIN` between the `Episode` and `Vote` tables using the `episode_id` column to combine the relevant data.    - Use a `WHERE` clause to filter the results for the specific episode ""S20-E12"".    - Calculate the average number of stars using the `AVG()` function on the `stars` column from the `Vote` table.    - Retrieve the `summary` column from the `Episode` table.  6. **Construct the SQL Query:**    - The SQL query should select the average stars and the summary for the specified episode:            SELECT AVG(T2.stars), T1.summary      FROM Episode AS T1      INNER JOIN Vote AS T2 ON T2.episode_id = T1.episode_id      WHERE T1.episode_id = 'S20-E12';        7. **Verify the Solution:**    - Ensure that the query correctly joins the tables and filters for the correct episode.    - Check that the `AVG()` function is correctly applied to the `stars` column to compute the average rating.  By following these logical steps, we can effectively construct a query to solve the problem and retrieve the desired information about the episode ""S20-E12"".",,

This involves extracting information about a specific person and their contribution to a particular season of a show.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - **Person Table**: This table contains information about individuals, including their birth names. The relevant columns are `name` and `birth_name`.    - **Credit Table**: This table contains information about the roles individuals played in various episodes. The relevant columns are `person` (which matches with `name` in the Person table), `role`, and `episode_id`.  3. **Determine the Relationship Between Tables**:     - The `Person` table and the `Credit` table are related through the `name` and `person` columns, respectively. This relationship allows us to join these tables to find the role of a specific person in the creation of the show.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - **Join the Tables**: Use an INNER JOIN to combine the `Person` and `Credit` tables on the condition that `Person.name` matches `Credit.person`.

The key elements here are the person (Billy Kimball), the year (2010), and the result (Nominee).  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**: From the schema provided, the relevant table for awards and nominations is the `Award` table. This table contains information about the award year, the person receiving the award, and the result (whether they won or were nominated).  3. **Identify Relevant Columns**: In the `Award` table, the columns of interest are:    - `person`: to filter records related to Billy Kimball.    - `year`: to filter records from the year 2010.    - `result`: to filter records where the result is 'Nominee'.    - `award_id`: to count the number of nominations.  4. **Formulate the Query**:    - **Filter by Person**: We need to filter the records where the `person` column matches 'Billy Kimball'.    - **Filter by Year**: We need to filter records where the `year` is 2010. Since the year is stored as a string, we can use the `SUBSTR` function to extract the year part and compare it to '2010'.    - **Filter by Result**: We need to filter records where the `result` is 'Nominee'.    - **Count Nominations**: Finally, we need to count the number of records that meet all these criteria, which corresponds to the number of nominations.  5. **Write the SQL Query**: Based on the above logic, the SQL query would be:        SELECT COUNT(award_id)     FROM Award     WHERE person = 'Billy Kimball'       AND SUBSTR(year, 1, 4) = '2010'       AND result = 'Nominee';      6. **Verify the Query**: Ensure that the query correctly counts the number of nominations for Billy Kimball in 2010. Check that all conditions are correctly applied and that the correct table and columns are used.  By following these steps, we systematically break down the problem and construct a query that answers the question posed.",,

Here's how you might approach the problem:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to calculate the average awards winning rate for Season 20 of ""The Simpsons.""    - The winning rate is defined as the percentage of awards won out of the total awards nominated.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - The `Award` table is crucial because it contains information about awards, including whether they were won or just nominated.    - The columns of interest in the `Award` table are `result` (to check if the award was won) and `episode_id` (to filter by Season 20).  3. **Filter Data for Season 20**:    - Use the `episode_id` column to filter awards related to Season 20. The `episode_id` format indicates season and episode (e.g., S20-E1 for Season 20, Episode 1).    - Ensure that only awards linked to Season 20 episodes are considered.  4. **Calculate Total Awards and Wins**:    - Count the total number of awards (`COUNT(award)`) for Season 20.    - Count the number of awards won (`SUM(CASE WHEN result = 'Winner' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)`) for Season 20.  5. **Compute Winning Rate**:    - Calculate the winning rate as a percentage:       \[      \text{Winning Rate} = \left(\frac{\text{Number of Wins}}{\text{Total Number of Awards}}\right) \times 100      \]    - Use SQL to perform this calculation, ensuring the result is cast to a real number for accurate percentage representation.  6. **Formulate SQL Query**:    - Combine the above logic into a single SQL query:            SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN result = 'Winner' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(award) AS rate       FROM Award       WHERE episode_id LIKE 'S20-%';          - The `LIKE 'S20-%'` clause filters awards to only those associated with Season 20 episodes.  7. **Verify and Validate**:    - Ensure the query correctly calculates the winning rate by checking against known data or test cases.    - Confirm that the logic aligns with the problem requirements and that the SQL syntax is correct.  By following these steps, you can systematically approach the problem and derive the solution using SQL.",,

These columns will help us filter the episodes by year and determine the one with the lowest rating.  3. **Filter Episodes by Year**: Since we are interested only in episodes aired in 2009, we need to filter the `Episode` table to include only those records where the `air_date` falls within the year 2009. This can be achieved using a `LIKE` clause on the `air_date` column.  4. **Sort Episodes by Rating**: Once we have the episodes from 2009, we need to identify the one with the worst (lowest) rating. This requires sorting the filtered episodes by the `rating` column in ascending order.  5. **Select the Episode with the Lowest Rating**: After sorting, the episode with the lowest rating will be the first record. We can use the `LIMIT 1` clause to select this episode.  6. **Write the SQL Query**: Combine the above steps into a single SQL query. The query should select the `episode_id` of the episode with the lowest rating from the filtered list of 2009 episodes.  7. **Verify the Query**: Ensure that the query correctly filters by year, sorts by rating, and limits the result to the episode with the lowest rating.

This involves identifying the relevant tables and columns that contain this information.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - From the schema provided, the `Credit` table is the most relevant because it contains columns for `category`, `role`, and `person`. These columns are directly related to the information we need to extract.  3. **Filter Data for the Specific Person**:    - Since we are interested in Bonita Pietila's contributions, we need to filter the `Credit` table to only include records where the `person` column matches 'Bonita Pietila'.  4. **Select Relevant Information**:    - We need to extract the `category` and `role` columns from the filtered data, as these are the specific pieces of information required by the problem statement.  5. **Ensure Uniqueness**:    - The problem asks for a list of categories and roles, implying that duplicate entries should be avoided. Therefore, we use the `DISTINCT` keyword to ensure that each combination of category and role is unique in the result set.  6. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Based on the above steps, the SQL query should select distinct `category` and `role` from the `Credit` table where the `person` is 'Bonita Pietila'.  7. **Review and Test the Query**:    - Finally, review the query to ensure it logically aligns with the problem requirements and test it against the database to verify it returns the expected results.  By following these steps, we can confidently construct the SQL query to solve the problem:   SELECT DISTINCT category, role  FROM Credit  WHERE person = 'Bonita Pietila';   This query effectively lists all unique categories and roles associated with Bonita Pietila in the `Credit` table.",,

This involves identifying the people associated with the role of 'producer' for episodes in this specific season.  2. **Review the Schema**: Look at the provided schema to identify relevant tables and columns. The schema includes tables like `Episode`, `Person`, `Award`, `Character_Award`, `Credit`, `Keyword`, and `Vote`.   3. **Identify Relevant Tables**: From the schema, the `Credit` table seems to be the most relevant because it contains columns related to `episode_id`, `category`, `person`, `role`, and `credited`. The `role` column is particularly important because it can specify the role of 'producer'.  4. **Focus on the `Credit` Table**: Since the `Credit` table contains information about roles and the people associated with them, we should focus on this table to find producers.  5. **Filter by Role**: We need to filter the entries in the `Credit` table where the `role` is 'producer'. This will give us the names of individuals who have been credited as producers.  6. **Ensure Uniqueness**: Since multiple episodes can have the same producer, and multiple producers can be credited for different episodes, use `DISTINCT` to ensure that each producer's name appears only once in the result.  7. **Construct the SQL Query**: Based on the above understanding, construct the SQL query to extract the distinct names of producers from the `Credit` table:        SELECT DISTINCT person FROM Credit WHERE role = 'producer';      8. **Verify the Solution**: Ensure that the query logically aligns with the problem statement and that it correctly extracts the desired information from the database.

We also need to provide the full name of the composer.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - **Award Table**: This table contains information about Emmy nominations, including the year, category, and the person nominated.    - **Person Table**: This table contains personal information about individuals, including their name and birthdate, which are necessary to calculate age.  3. **Determine Necessary Joins**:    - We need to join the `Award` table with the `Person` table to connect the nomination information with the composer's personal details. The common column for this join is the `name` in the `Person` table and the `person` in the `Award` table.  4. **Filter for Specific Criteria**:    - We need to filter the `Award` table for nominations in the category ""Outstanding Music Composition for a Series (Original Dramatic Score)"".    - The nomination should be from the ""Primetime Emmy Awards"" organization.    - The result should be ""Nominee"", and the year should be 2009.    - Additionally, we need to ensure that the role is specifically ""composer"".  5. **Calculate Age**:    - Once we have the relevant nomination and personal information, calculate the age of the composer in 2009 by subtracting the birth year from 2009.  6. **Select Required Information**:    - Select the calculated age and the full name of the composer from the results.  7. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Using the above logic, construct the SQL query to retrieve the desired information.  Here is the SQL query that implements these steps:   SELECT      T1.year - EXTRACT(YEAR FROM T2.birthdate) AS ageIn2009,      T2.name  FROM      Award AS T1  INNER JOIN      Person AS T2  ON      T1.person = T2.name  WHERE      T1.role = 'composer'      AND T1.organization = 'Primetime Emmy Awards'      AND T1.award = 'Outstanding Music Composition for a Series (Original Dramatic Score)'      AND T1.result = 'Nominee'      AND T1.year = 2009;   By following these steps, we ensure that we accurately retrieve the composer's age and full name based on the specified criteria.",,

This requires identifying the relevant data columns and tables that contain information about crew members and their birthplaces.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - The `Person` table is likely to contain information about individuals involved in the production, such as crew members.    - The `Person` table includes columns like `name`, `birth_place`, `birth_region`, and `birth_country`, which are relevant for determining the birthplace of the crew members.  3. **Focus on Birthplace Information**:    - Since the problem specifically asks for crew members born in the USA, the `birth_country` column in the `Person` table is crucial. This column directly indicates the country of birth.  4. **Formulate the Query**:    - To count the number of crew members born in the USA, we need to filter the `Person` table where `birth_country` is 'USA'.    - Use the SQL `COUNT` function to count the number of entries that meet this condition.  5. **Write the SQL Query**:    - The SQL query should select the count of names from the `Person` table where the `birth_country` is 'USA'.    - The query is: `SELECT COUNT(name) FROM Person WHERE birth_country = 'USA';`  6. **Verify the Solution**:    - Ensure that the query accurately reflects the problem's requirements and that it correctly counts the number of crew members born in the USA.    - Consider any edge cases, such as missing or null values in the `birth_country` column, and ensure they are handled appropriately.  By following these steps, we can logically derive the solution to the problem, ensuring that the query accurately counts the number of crew members born in the USA.",,

The key information required is the birthdate of each crew member.  2. **Examine the Schema**: Review the provided database schema to identify where the necessary information is stored. In this case, the `Person` table contains the `name` and `birthdate` columns, which are relevant to the problem.  3. **Identify Relevant Columns**: From the `Person` table, the `name` column is needed to list the crew members' names, and the `birthdate` column is needed to determine if they were born before 1970.  4. **Determine the Condition**: The condition to filter the crew members is based on their birth year. We need to extract the year from the `birthdate` column and compare it to 1970.  5. **Extract the Year**: The `birthdate` is likely stored in a string format (e.g., 'YYYY-MM-DD'). To extract the year, we can use a string function like `SUBSTR` to get the first four characters, which represent the year.  6. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Use the `SELECT` statement to retrieve the `name` column.    - Use the `FROM` clause to specify the `Person` table.    - Use the `WHERE` clause to apply the condition: `SUBSTR(birthdate, 1, 4) < '1970'`. This condition checks if the extracted year is less than 1970.  7. **Consider Edge Cases**: Ensure that the query handles cases where the `birthdate` might be `NULL` or improperly formatted. However, based on the problem statement, we assume valid data.  8. **Write and Test the Query**: Construct the SQL query and test it against the database to ensure it returns the correct results.  The final SQL query is:  SELECT name FROM Person WHERE SUBSTR(birthdate, 1, 4) < '1970';   This query effectively lists the names of crew members born before 1970 by extracting and comparing the year from the `birthdate` column.",,

This requires filtering data based on specific criteria.  2. **Review the Schema**:    - Identify the relevant tables and columns. The schema provided includes several tables, but we need to focus on the one that contains information about episode ratings and votes.    - The `Vote` table contains columns `episode_id`, `stars`, and `votes`, which are directly related to the problem statement.  3. **Identify the Relevant Table and Columns**:    - The `Vote` table is relevant because it contains the `stars` and `votes` columns, which are necessary for filtering the data.    - The `episode_id` column in the `Vote` table will be used to identify the episodes that meet the criteria.  4. **Determine the Filtering Criteria**:    - We need to filter rows where the `stars` column equals 5, indicating a 5-star rating.    - Additionally, we need to filter rows where the `votes` column is greater than 100.  5. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Use a `SELECT` statement to retrieve the `episode_id` from the `Vote` table.    - Apply a `WHERE` clause to filter the rows based on the criteria: `stars = 5` and `votes > 100`.  6. **Write the SQL Query**:    - The SQL query should be structured as follows:            SELECT episode_id FROM Vote WHERE stars = 5 AND votes > 100;        7. **Verify the Solution**:    - Ensure that the query accurately reflects the problem requirements and that it will return the correct episode IDs based on the specified conditions.

The `Keyword` table contains keywords associated with episodes, identified by `episode_id`.  3. **Determine the Relationship Between Tables**: The `Episode` table and the `Keyword` table can be linked via the `episode_id` column. This common column allows us to join these tables to find the keywords for a specific episode.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - **Select the Desired Information**: We want to retrieve the `keyword` from the `Keyword` table.    - **Join the Tables**: Use an INNER JOIN to combine the `Episode` and `Keyword` tables on the `episode_id` column. This will allow us to access keywords for each episode.    - **Filter by Episode Title**: Use a WHERE clause to filter the results to only include the episode with the title ""Double, Double, Boy in Trouble.""  5. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Start with the SELECT statement to specify that we want the `keyword` column.    - Use INNER JOIN to connect `Episode` (aliased as T1) and `Keyword` (aliased as T2) on `episode_id`.    - Add a WHERE clause to filter by the specific title.  6. **Write the Final Query**:        SELECT T2.keyword     FROM Episode AS T1     INNER JOIN Keyword AS T2     ON T1.episode_id = T2.episode_id     WHERE T1.title = 'Double, Double, Boy in Trouble';      By following these logical steps, we ensure that we correctly identify and retrieve the keywords associated with the specified episode title.",,

Here's how we can break down the problem and arrive at the solution:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to find the keywords associated with an episode that won a Primetime Emmy Award.  2. **Analyze the Schema**:    - We have several tables: `Episode`, `Person`, `Award`, `Character_Award`, `Credit`, `Keyword`, and `Vote`.    - The `Award` table contains information about awards, including the `award_category` and `result`.    - The `Keyword` table contains keywords associated with each episode, identified by `episode_id`.  3. **Identify Relevant Tables**:    - The `Award` table is crucial because it contains information about which episodes won awards.    - The `Keyword` table is necessary because it contains the keywords we need to extract.  4. **Determine the Relationship Between Tables**:    - Both the `Award` and `Keyword` tables have a common column, `episode_id`, which can be used to join these tables.  5. **Formulate the Query**:    - We need to join the `Award` table with the `Keyword` table using the `episode_id` column.    - We are interested in episodes that won a Primetime Emmy, so we need to filter the `Award` table where `award_category` is 'Primetime Emmy' and `result` is 'Winner'.  6. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Use an INNER JOIN to combine the `Award` and `Keyword` tables based on `episode_id`.    - Apply a WHERE clause to filter for the specific award category ('Primetime Emmy') and result ('Winner').    - Select the `keyword` column from the `Keyword` table.  7. **Review the Solution**:    - Ensure the query accurately reflects the problem requirements and retrieves the correct data.  Here is the SQL query that implements these steps:   SELECT T2.keyword  FROM Award AS T1  INNER JOIN Keyword AS T2 ON T2.episode_id = T1.episode_id  WHERE T1.award_category = 'Primetime Emmy' AND T1.result = 'Winner';   This query will return the keywords for the episode that won the Primetime Emmy Award, as required by the problem statement.",,

The `Award` table has a `year` column, which we can use to filter entries for the year 2009.  5. **Filter by Role**:    - We are specifically interested in writers, so we need to filter the `Award` table where the `role` is 'writer'.  6. **Filter by Star Score**:    - The problem specifies a star score greater than 5. This information is typically found in the `Vote` table.    - However, the provided solution uses `votes` from the `Episode` table, which seems to be a misunderstanding. The `Vote` table should be used to filter based on the `stars` column.  7. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Start with a `SELECT` statement to retrieve the `person` (writer) from the `Award` table.    - Use an `INNER JOIN` to combine `Award` and `Episode` tables on `episode_id`.    - Add `WHERE` conditions to filter:      - `SUBSTR(T1.year, 1, 4) = '2009'` to ensure the year is 2009.      - `T1.role = 'writer'` to ensure the role is a writer.      - `T2.votes > 5` should actually be `T2.stars > 5` if using the `Vote` table, but based on the provided solution, it seems there is a misunderstanding in the schema.  8. **Review and Adjust**:    - Ensure the logic aligns with the schema and requirements.    - If necessary, adjust the query to correctly use the `Vote` table for star scores.  By following these steps, you can logically deduce the solution to the problem, ensuring that each condition and join is correctly applied to retrieve the desired results.",,

The relevant columns are `name` and `birth_country`.    - **Award Table**: This table contains information about awards, including the person who received the award, the award category, and the year the award was given. The relevant columns are `person`, `award_category`, and `year`.  3. **Determine the Necessary Join**:    - We need to join the `Person` table and the `Award` table to link individuals with the awards they received. The common column between these two tables is the `name` column in the `Person` table and the `person` column in the `Award` table.  4. **Filter by Award Category**:    - We are only interested in the WGA Award (TV), so we need to filter the `Award` table by the `award_category` column to include only rows where `award_category` is 'WGA Award (TV)'.  5. **Filter by Birth Country**:    - We need to ensure that the individuals were born in the USA. Therefore, we filter the `Person` table by the `birth_country` column to include only rows where `birth_country` is 'USA'.  6. **Filter by Year**:    - The problem specifies the years 2009 to 2010. We need to filter the `Award` table by the `year` column to include only rows where the `year` is between 2009 and 2010.  7. **Count the Results**:    - After applying the necessary filters and performing the join, we count the number of resulting rows to determine how many individuals meet all the criteria.  8. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Combine all the above steps into a SQL query:            SELECT COUNT(*)      FROM Person AS T1      INNER JOIN Award AS T2 ON T1.name = T2.person      WHERE T2.award_category = 'WGA Award (TV)'      AND T1.birth_country = 'USA'      AND T2.year BETWEEN 2009 AND 2010;        By following these logical steps, we can systematically arrive at the solution to the problem.",,

This requires us to access the votes data for these specific episodes.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:     - The `Episode` table contains information about each episode, including the `episode_id` and `episode` number.    - The `Vote` table contains the number of votes for each episode, identified by `episode_id`.  3. **Determine the Relationship Between Tables**:     - The `Episode` table can be joined with the `Vote` table using the `episode_id` column, which is common to both tables. This allows us to associate each episode with its corresponding votes.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Use an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Episode` and `Vote` tables on the `episode_id` column. This will allow us to access both the episode number and the votes in a single query.    - Use a `CASE` statement within a `SUM` function to conditionally sum the votes for episode 1 and episode 5 separately.       - For episode 1, add the votes to the sum when `episode = 1`.      - For episode 5, add the votes to a different sum when `episode = 5`.  5. **Calculate the Difference**:    - Subtract the sum of votes for episode 5 from the sum of votes for episode 1 to get the difference.  6. **Alias the Result**:    - Use `AS diff` to give a meaningful name to the result of the subtraction, indicating that it represents the difference in votes.  7. **Write the Final SQL Query**:    - Combine all the above steps into a single SQL query:            SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN T1.episode = 1 THEN T2.votes ELSE 0 END) - SUM(CASE WHEN T1.episode = 5 THEN T2.votes ELSE 0 END) AS diff      FROM Episode AS T1      INNER JOIN Vote AS T2 ON T2.episode_id = T1.episode_id;        8. **Verify the Solution**:    - Ensure that the query accurately reflects the problem requirements and correctly calculates the difference in votes between episode 1 and episode 5.

This will give us the total number of American recipients.  5. **Calculate the Total Number of Recipients**:    - Use the `COUNT(*)` function to get the total number of recipients in the filtered dataset.  6. **Calculate the Percentage**:    - Divide the number of American recipients by the total number of recipients and multiply by 100 to get the percentage.  7. **Write the Final SQL Query**:    - Combine all these steps into a single SQL query:            SELECT         SUM(CASE WHEN T1.birth_country = 'USA' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS num,        CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN T1.birth_country = 'USA' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(*) AS percentage      FROM         Person AS T1      INNER JOIN         Award AS T2       ON         T1.name = T2.person      WHERE         T2.award_category = 'Primetime Emmy';        8. **Verify and Test**:    - Ensure the query logic is correct and test it with sample data to verify the results are as expected.

Here's how we can approach the problem:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: We need to find crew members who were born in 1962 in California. This requires us to filter data based on birth year and birth region.  2. **Identify Relevant Table**: From the provided schema, the `Person` table contains information about crew members, including their birthdate and birth region. This is the table we need to query.  3. **Determine Necessary Columns**: We need to extract the `name` of the crew members. To filter the data, we will use the `birthdate` and `birth_region` columns.  4. **Extract Year from Birthdate**: The `birthdate` column is in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`. To filter by year, we need to extract the year part. We can use the SQL function `SUBSTR` to get the first four characters of the `birthdate`, which represent the year.  5. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Use the `SELECT` statement to specify that we want to retrieve the `name` column.    - Use the `FROM` clause to specify the `Person` table as the source of data.    - Use the `WHERE` clause to filter records:      - Use `SUBSTR(birthdate, 1, 4) = '1962'` to filter for people born in 1962.      - Use `birth_region = 'California'` to filter for people born in California.  6. **Combine Conditions**: Combine the conditions in the `WHERE` clause using the `AND` operator to ensure both conditions are satisfied.  7. **Review and Execute the Query**: Ensure the query is correctly formulated and execute it to retrieve the desired results.  The final SQL query is:  SELECT name FROM Person WHERE SUBSTR(birthdate, 1, 4) = '1962' AND birth_region = 'California';   By following these steps, we logically deduce how to extract the required information from the database schema provided.",,

This will give us the subset of crew members who are taller than 1.70 meters.  4. **Filter Based on Birth Country**:    - Further filter the subset obtained in the previous step to include only those records where the `birth_country` column is 'Canada'. This will narrow down the list to crew members who are both taller than 1.70 meters and born in Canada.  5. **Count the Number of Matching Records**:    - Use the `COUNT` function to determine the number of records that meet both criteria. This will give us the total number of crew members who satisfy the conditions.  6. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Combine the above steps into a single SQL query. The query will use a `SELECT` statement with a `COUNT` function, and `WHERE` clause to apply the necessary filters.  7. **Review and Validate**:    - Ensure that the query accurately reflects the problem statement and that the logic is correctly implemented. Double-check the column names and table structure to avoid errors.  By following these steps, you can construct the SQL query to solve the problem:   SELECT COUNT(name)  FROM Person  WHERE height_meters > 1.70  AND birth_country = 'Canada';   This query will count the number of crew members in the `Person` table who are taller than 1.70 meters and were born in Canada.",,

Based on common understanding and the provided data samples, ratings between 7 and 10 can be considered excellent.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - **Select the Relevant Column**: We need to display the titles of the episodes, so we will select the `title` column.    - **Filter Based on Rating**: Use a `WHERE` clause to filter episodes with ratings between 7 and 10.    - **Limit the Results**: Since we only need any three episodes, use the `LIMIT` clause to restrict the output to three records.  5. **Construct the SQL Query**: Combine the above logic into a SQL query:        SELECT title FROM Episode WHERE rating BETWEEN 7 AND 10 LIMIT 3;      6. **Verify the Query**: Ensure that the query correctly selects and limits the episodes based on the defined excellent rating criteria.

Here are the logical steps that could have been taken to reach the solution:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: The task is to find the ""top five most popular episodes."" Popularity in this context can be interpreted as the number of votes an episode has received, as this is a common metric for gauging popularity.  2. **Review the Schema**: Examine the provided schema to identify which table and columns contain data relevant to determining episode popularity. The `Episode` table is the most relevant as it contains columns like `episode_id`, `rating`, and `votes`.  3. **Identify the Key Metric for Popularity**: Decide on the metric to use for determining popularity. In this case, the `votes` column in the `Episode` table is a direct indicator of how many people have voted on an episode, which is a strong indicator of its popularity.  4. **Formulate the Query**:    - **Select the Relevant Data**: We need to retrieve the `episode_id` of the episodes because the problem asks for the identification of episodes.    - **Order the Data**: To find the top five episodes, we need to sort the episodes by the number of votes in descending order.

This involves identifying the relevant tables and columns that can provide this information.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**:    - The `Award` table contains information about awards, including the person who received the award and the type of award.    - The `Character_Award` table links awards to specific characters.  3. **Determine Necessary Conditions**:    - We need to find awards related to voice-over performances, specifically those awarded to Dan Castellaneta.    - We need to link these awards to the characters they were associated with.  4. **Formulate the Query**:    - Start by selecting the character information from the `Character_Award` table.    - Join the `Award` table with the `Character_Award` table using the `award_id` column, which is common to both tables. This will allow us to filter awards based on specific criteria.  5. **Apply Conditions**:    - Filter the `Award` table to include only those records where the `award` column contains the phrase ""Voice-Over"". This ensures we are only considering voice-over awards.    - Further filter these records to include only those where the `person` column is ""Dan Castellaneta"", as we are interested in awards received by him.  6. **Ensure Uniqueness**:    - Use `SELECT DISTINCT` to ensure that the query returns unique character names, as there might be multiple entries for the same character if Dan Castellaneta received multiple awards for the same role.  7. **Execute the Query**:    - The final SQL query is constructed as follows:            SELECT DISTINCT T2.character      FROM Award AS T1      INNER JOIN Character_Award AS T2 ON T1.award_id = T2.award_id      WHERE T1.award LIKE '%Voice-Over%'      AND T1.person = 'Dan Castellaneta';          - This query will return the distinct character names for which Dan Castellaneta received a voice-over award.  By following these steps, we systematically narrow down the data to find the specific character associated with Dan Castellaneta's award-winning voice-over performance.",,

The `air_date` column in the `Episode` table contains this information.    - Extract the year from the `air_date` and filter for the year 2008.  4. **Identify Maximum Star Rating:**    - We need to find the maximum star rating for each episode. This can be done by examining the `stars` column in the `Vote` table.  5. **Find the Highest Number of Votes for Maximum Star Rating:**    - For each episode that aired in 2008, identify the maximum star rating and then find the number of votes corresponding to this rating.    - Use the `Vote` table to get the number of votes for the maximum star rating.  6. **Join Tables:**    - Join the `Episode` table with the `Vote` table on `episode_id` to associate each episode with its voting details.  7. **Order and Limit Results:**    - Order the results by the number of votes in descending order to find the episode with the highest number of votes for the maximum star rating.    - Use `LIMIT 1` to select the top episode.  8. **Formulate the SQL Query:**    - Combine all the above steps into a coherent SQL query:            SELECT T1.episode_id       FROM Episode AS T1       INNER JOIN Vote AS T2 ON T2.episode_id = T1.episode_id       WHERE SUBSTR(T1.air_date, 1, 4) = '2008'       ORDER BY T2.votes DESC       LIMIT 1;        By following these logical steps, we ensure that we correctly identify the episode that meets the criteria specified in the problem statement.",,

This ensures we are only retrieving keywords for the correct episode.  7. **Select Keywords**: Finally, we select the `keyword` column from the `Keyword` table to get the list of keywords associated with the specified episode.  8. **Write the SQL Query**: Based on the above steps, we construct the SQL query to perform the join, apply the filter, and select the desired data:         SELECT T2.keyword     FROM Episode AS T1     INNER JOIN Keyword AS T2     ON T1.episode_id = T2.episode_id     WHERE T1.title = 'Take My Life, Please';      By following these steps, we logically deduce how to retrieve the keywords for the episode titled ""Take My Life, Please"" using the given schema and tables.",,

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logical reasoning process to arrive at the solution:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to identify two episodes that have the keyword ""1930s to 2020s"" associated with them.    - The output should be the names (titles) of these episodes.  2. **Analyze the Schema**:    - The `Episode` table contains information about each episode, including its `episode_id` and `title`.    - The `Keyword` table associates keywords with episodes using the `episode_id`.  3. **Identify Relevant Tables**:    - We need to use the `Episode` table to get the episode titles.    - We need to use the `Keyword` table to filter episodes by the specific keyword ""1930s to 2020s"".  4. **Determine the Relationship Between Tables**:    - The `episode_id` is the common column between the `Episode` and `Keyword` tables. This allows us to join these tables to associate episode titles with their keywords.  5. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Use an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Episode` and `Keyword` tables on the `episode_id`.    - Filter the results to include only those rows where the `keyword` is ""1930s to 2020s"".  6. **Select the Required Columns**:    - From the joined tables, select the `title` from the `Episode` table, as this is the desired output.  7. **Limit the Results**:    - Since the problem asks for any two episodes, use the `LIMIT` clause to restrict the output to two episode titles.  8. **Construct the Final SQL Query**:    - Combine all the steps into a coherent SQL query:            SELECT T1.title       FROM Episode AS T1       INNER JOIN Keyword AS T2       ON T1.episode_id = T2.episode_id       WHERE T2.keyword = '1930s to 2020s'       LIMIT 2;        By following these logical steps, we ensure that the query retrieves exactly what is needed: two episode titles that have the specified keyword.",,

This requires us to focus on the `Award` and `Episode` tables, as they contain relevant information about awards and episodes respectively.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - **Award Table**: This table contains information about awards, including the `year`, `person` (who won the award), and `episode_id` (the episode associated with the award).    - **Episode Table**: This table contains details about each episode, including the `episode_id` and `title`.  3. **Determine the Necessary Join**:    - Since we need to link the award information to the episode details, we should perform an INNER JOIN between the `Award` and `Episode` tables using the `episode_id` column, which is common to both tables.  4. **Filter for the Year 2010**:    - We need to filter the results to only include awards from the year 2010. This can be done by checking the `year` column in the `Award` table. Ensure that the year is extracted correctly, considering any formatting issues (e.g., if the year is stored as a string).  5. **Filter for Joel H. Cohen**:    - Additionally, we need to filter the results to only include awards won by Joel H. Cohen. This involves checking the `person` column in the `Award` table for the name 'Joel H. Cohen'.  6. **Select the Required Information**:    - Finally, we need to select the `title` of the episode from the `Episode` table that corresponds to the award won by Joel H. Cohen in 2010.  7. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Using the above logic, we construct the SQL query:            SELECT T2.title       FROM Award AS T1       INNER JOIN Episode AS T2 ON T1.episode_id = T2.episode_id       WHERE SUBSTR(T1.year, 1, 4) = '2010'       AND T1.person = 'Joel H. Cohen';          - This query joins the `Award` and `Episode` tables on `episode_id`, filters for awards in 2010 and for Joel H. Cohen, and selects the episode title.

Identify which tables contain relevant information for the problem. In this case, the `Episode` table contains episode details including titles, and the `Vote` table contains voting details for each episode.  2. **Identify Relevant Columns**:    - From the `Episode` table, the columns of interest are `episode_id` and `title` because we need to find the episode titled ""Lisa the Drama Queen"".    - From the `Vote` table, the columns of interest are `episode_id`, `stars`, and `votes` because we need to find the number of 5-star votes for the specific episode.  3. **Determine the Relationship Between Tables**:    - Recognize that the `episode_id` column is the common key between the `Episode` and `Vote` tables. This allows us to join these tables to combine episode information with voting details.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Use an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Episode` and `Vote` tables on the `episode_id` column. This will allow us to access both episode titles and their corresponding votes.    - Apply a `WHERE` clause to filter the results to only include the episode titled ""Lisa the Drama Queen"". This ensures we are only considering votes for the correct episode.    - Further filter the results to include only rows where the `stars` column equals 5, as we are interested in 5-star votes.    - Use the `SUM()` function to aggregate the total number of 5-star votes for the specified episode.  5. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Combine all the above steps into a coherent SQL query:            SELECT SUM(T2.votes)      FROM Episode AS T1      INNER JOIN Vote AS T2 ON T2.episode_id = T1.episode_id      WHERE T1.title = 'Lisa the Drama Queen' AND T2.stars = 5;        6. **Verify the Solution**:    - Ensure that the query logically follows the problem requirements and correctly uses SQL syntax.    - Consider edge cases, such as ensuring the episode title is unique in the dataset, to avoid incorrect results.

Here are the logical steps to arrive at the solution:  1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to find the number of 10-star votes for a specific episode identified by a keyword. The keyword we are interested in is ""reference to the fantastic four.""  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**:     - The `Keyword` table contains information about keywords associated with episodes. We will use this table to find the episode with the desired keyword.    - The `Vote` table contains information about the number of votes for different star ratings for each episode. We will use this table to find the number of 10-star votes.  3. **Determine the Join Condition**:     - Both the `Keyword` and `Vote` tables have a common column, `episode_id`, which can be used to join these tables. This will allow us to link the keyword information with the voting information for the same episode.  4. **Formulate the Query**:    - Start by selecting the `votes` column from the `Vote` table, as this is the information we need.    - Use an INNER JOIN to combine the `Keyword` and `Vote` tables based on the `episode_id` column.    - Add a WHERE clause to filter the results:      - Specify `T2.stars = 10` to focus on 10-star votes.      - Specify `T1.keyword = 'reference to the fantastic four'` to filter for the episode with the desired keyword.  5. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Use the alias `T1` for the `Keyword` table and `T2` for the `Vote` table for clarity and brevity.    - The final query is:            SELECT T2.votes       FROM Keyword AS T1       INNER JOIN Vote AS T2       ON T1.episode_id = T2.episode_id       WHERE T2.stars = 10       AND T1.keyword = 'reference to the fantastic four';        6. **Verify the Logic**:    - Ensure that the join condition correctly links the episodes by `episode_id`.    - Confirm that the WHERE clause accurately filters for both the 10-star votes and the specific keyword.  By following these steps, we can effectively retrieve the number of 10-star votes for the episode that includes the keyword ""reference to the fantastic four.""",,

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to find the keywords associated with the least popular episode. ""Least popular"" is typically determined by the number of votes an episode has received.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - **Episode Table**: This table contains information about each episode, including the `episode_id`, `votes`, and other details. The `votes` column will help us determine the popularity of each episode.    - **Keyword Table**: This table contains `episode_id` and `keyword`. We need this table to find the keywords associated with a particular episode.  3. **Determine the Criteria for ""Least Popular""**:    - The least popular episode can be identified by finding the episode with the minimum number of votes. Therefore, we need to sort the episodes by the `votes` column in ascending order.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - **Join the Episode and Keyword Tables**: We need to join these tables on the `episode_id` to access both the votes and keywords for each episode.    - **Order by Votes**: Sort the joined result by the `votes` column in ascending order to bring the least popular episode to the top.    - **Select Keywords**: After sorting, select the `keyword` from the top result, which corresponds to the least popular episode.    - **Limit the Result**: Use `LIMIT 1` to ensure we only get the keywords for the single least popular episode.  5. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Using the above logic, the SQL query can be constructed as follows:            SELECT T2.keyword       FROM Episode AS T1       INNER JOIN Keyword AS T2 ON T1.episode_id = T2.episode_id       ORDER BY T1.votes       LIMIT 1;          - This query joins the `Episode` table with the `Keyword` table on `episode_id`, orders the results by the `votes` column in ascending order, and selects the `keyword` from the least popular episode.  By following these logical steps, we arrive at a solution that efficiently retrieves the keywords of the least popular episode based on the number of votes.",,

This can be done using a `WHERE` clause in the main query:            SELECT episode FROM Episode WHERE votes = (SELECT MAX(votes) FROM Episode);        5. **Consider Edge Cases**:    - Consider if there are multiple episodes with the same maximum number of votes. The query will return all such episodes.    - Ensure that the `votes` column is not null for any episode, as this could affect the result. However, based on the schema, it seems `votes` is populated for all episodes.  6. **Verify the Solution**:    - Check the query against the sample data to ensure it returns the correct episode(s) with the highest number of votes.    - Validate the logic by considering different scenarios, such as varying numbers of episodes and votes.

Here’s how we can break down the reasoning process:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to find the oldest individual among all the casts and crews involved in the episodes. This implies we need to look at the birthdates of all individuals associated with the episodes.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**:    - From the schema, the `Person` table contains information about individuals, including their names and birthdates. This table is crucial for solving the problem as it contains the birthdate information needed to determine who is the oldest.  3. **Determine the Necessary Columns**:    - To find the oldest person, we need the `name` and `birthdate` columns from the `Person` table. The `name` column will give us the identity of the person, and the `birthdate` column will allow us to determine their age.  4. **Formulate the Query Logic**:    - To find the oldest person, we need to sort the individuals by their birthdate in ascending order. The oldest person will have the earliest birthdate.  5. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Use the `ORDER BY` clause to sort the records in the `Person` table by the `birthdate` column in ascending order. This will arrange the persons from the oldest to the youngest.    - Use the `LIMIT 1` clause to select only the first record from the sorted list, which corresponds to the oldest person.  6. **Write the SQL Query**:    - The final SQL query is: `SELECT name FROM Person ORDER BY birthdate ASC LIMIT 1;`    - This query selects the `name` of the oldest person by ordering all entries in the `Person` table by `birthdate` in ascending order and limiting the result to the first entry.  By following these steps, we logically deduce that the solution involves sorting the `Person` table by birthdate and selecting the top record to find the oldest individual.",,

Here's how we can approach the problem:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: We need to find out which episodes Oscar Cervantes is credited with. This involves identifying the relevant data and understanding the schema provided.  2. **Analyze the Schema**: Review the tables and their columns to determine where the necessary information might be stored. The schema includes tables like `Episode`, `Person`, `Award`, `Character_Award`, `Credit`, `Keyword`, and `Vote`.  3. **Identify Relevant Tables**: Based on the problem statement, we need to focus on the `Credit` table. This table contains information about credits associated with episodes, including the `episode_id`, `category`, `person`, `role`, and `credited` status.  4. **Determine the Required Columns**: From the `Credit` table, the columns of interest are `episode_id`, `person`, and `credited`. We need to filter records where `person` is Oscar Cervantes and `credited` is true.  5. **Formulate the Query**: Construct an SQL query that selects the `episode_id` from the `Credit` table where the `person` is 'Oscar Cervantes' and `credited` is 'true'. This will give us the list of episodes Oscar Cervantes is credited with.  6. **Write the SQL Query**: Based on the above understanding, the SQL query is:        SELECT episode_id FROM Credit WHERE person = 'Oscar Cervantes' AND credited = 'true';      7. **Verify the Query**: Ensure that the query correctly captures the requirements of the problem statement. It should return all `episode_id`s where Oscar Cervantes is credited.  8. **Consider Edge Cases**: Think about any potential edge cases, such as if Oscar Cervantes is not credited in any episode or if there are multiple entries for the same episode. The query as written will handle these cases by returning an empty result set or listing all relevant episodes.  By following these steps, we logically deduce the necessary SQL query to solve the problem.",,

This can be done by ordering the episodes by the `rating` column in ascending order and selecting the top result.  4. **Join the Tables:**    - To count the 1-star ratings for the worst-rated episode, join the `Episode` and `Vote` tables on the `episode_id` column. This will allow us to correlate the ratings data with the vote data.  5. **Filter for 1-Star Ratings:**    - In the joined result, filter the rows where the `stars` column in the `Vote` table is equal to 1. This will isolate the votes that are specifically 1-star ratings.  6. **Count the 1-Star Ratings:**    - Use the `COUNT(*)` function to count the number of 1-star ratings for the worst-rated episode identified in step 3.  7. **Limit the Result to the Worst-Rated Episode:**    - Ensure that the query only returns data for the worst-rated episode by using the `ORDER BY` clause on the `rating` column and limiting the result to 1 using the `LIMIT` clause.  8. **Construct the SQL Query:**    - Combine all the steps into a single SQL query:            SELECT COUNT(*)      FROM Episode AS T1      INNER JOIN Vote AS T2 ON T2.episode_id = T1.episode_id      WHERE T2.stars = 1      ORDER BY T1.rating      LIMIT 1;        9. **Verify the Solution:**    - Double-check the logic and the query to ensure it accurately reflects the problem statement and correctly uses the schema provided.

This will allow us to access the episode details for each person listed in the `Credit` table.    - **Filter by Person**: Add a WHERE clause to filter the results to only include entries where the person is 'Emily Blunt'.

This means we need to identify a person associated with this nickname and then determine their role in the show.  2. **Examine the Schema**: Review the provided schema to identify relevant tables and columns. We have tables like `Person`, `Credit`, `Episode`, and others. The `Person` table contains a `nickname` column, which is crucial for identifying ""The Tiny Canadian"".  3. **Identify the Relevant Tables**:    - **Person Table**: This table contains personal information, including the `nickname` column, which we need to use to identify ""The Tiny Canadian"".    - **Credit Table**: This table contains information about people involved in the show and their roles. It includes columns like `person` and `role`, which are essential for finding out what role ""The Tiny Canadian"" played.  4. **Determine the Relationship Between Tables**:     - The `Credit` table has a `person` column that can be linked to the `name` column in the `Person` table. This relationship allows us to join these tables and extract the role information for a specific person.  5. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Use an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Person` and `Credit` tables based on the matching `name` and `person` columns.    - Filter the results to include only the records where the `nickname` in the `Person` table is ""The Tiny Canadian"".  6. **Write the SQL Query**:    - The query should select the `role` from the `Credit` table for the person with the nickname ""The Tiny Canadian"".    - The SQL query is:            SELECT T2.role       FROM Person AS T1       INNER JOIN Credit AS T2       ON T1.name = T2.person       WHERE T1.nickname = 'The Tiny Canadian';        7. **Verify the Solution**: Ensure that the query correctly identifies the role by checking if the join and filter conditions are correctly applied. The query should return the role(s) associated with ""The Tiny Canadian"".  By following these steps, we can logically deduce the solution to the problem and construct the appropriate SQL query.",,

This requires identifying the relevant tables and columns that contain information about episodes and their credited cast.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**:    - **Episode Table**: This table contains information about episodes, including their titles. We need this table to locate the episode by its title.    - **Credit Table**: This table contains information about the credits for each episode, including the category (e.g., Cast) and whether the credit is acknowledged (credited).  3. **Determine Necessary Columns**:    - From the **Episode Table**, we need the `episode_id` and `title` columns to identify the specific episode.    - From the **Credit Table**, we need the `episode_id`, `category`, `person`, and `credited` columns to find the credited cast members.  4. **Formulate the Query**:    - **Join the Tables**: Use an INNER JOIN to combine the Episode and Credit tables based on the `episode_id`.

This ensures that we only get the cast members who are officially credited.  5. **Select the Desired Output**:    - Use SELECT DISTINCT to retrieve unique names of the credited cast members. This ensures that each cast member is listed only once, even if they have multiple roles or credits.  6. **Execute and Validate the Query**:    - Run the SQL query to ensure it returns the expected results. Check the output to confirm that it lists the credited cast members for the specified episode.

Here’s a breakdown of the reasoning process:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to list the birth dates of individuals who have won awards.  2. **Analyze the Schema**:    - Identify the relevant tables and columns in the schema that can help solve the problem.    - The `Person` table contains information about individuals, including their `name` and `birthdate`.    - The `Award` table contains information about awards, including the `person` who won the award and the `result` of the award (e.g., Winner, Nominee).  3. **Identify the Relationship Between Tables**:    - Determine how the `Person` and `Award` tables are related.    - The `Award` table has a `person` column that corresponds to the `name` column in the `Person` table. This relationship allows us to join these tables.  4. **Determine the Criteria for Selection**:    - We are interested in individuals who have won awards. Therefore, we need to filter the `Award` table to include only rows where the `result` is 'Winner'.  5. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Start by selecting the `birthdate` from the `Person` table, as this is the information we need to list.    - Use an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Person` and `Award` tables based on the matching `name` and `person` columns.    - Apply a `WHERE` clause to filter the results to only include award winners (`result = 'Winner'`).  6. **Construct the Query**:    - The SQL query is constructed as follows:            SELECT T1.birthdate       FROM Person AS T1       INNER JOIN Award AS T2       ON T1.name = T2.person       WHERE T2.result = 'Winner';        7. **Review and Validate**:    - Ensure that the query accurately reflects the requirements of the problem statement.    - Check that the join condition and the filter criteria are correctly applied to retrieve the desired results.  By following these steps, we can logically derive the solution to the problem of listing all award winners' birth dates using the given database schema.",,

This is done by selecting rows where `stars = 10`.    - We then need to determine which episode received the most 10-star votes.

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to list all information about the music department's casts and crews. This implies that we are interested in people who have roles in the music department.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**:    - The `Credit` table contains information about people involved in various departments, including the music department. It has columns for `episode_id`, `category`, `person`, `role`, and `credited`.    - The `Person` table contains detailed information about individuals, such as `name`, `birthdate`, `birth_name`, `birth_place`, `birth_region`, `birth_country`, `height_meters`, and `nickname`.  3. **Determine the Relationship Between Tables**:    - The `Credit` table has a `person` column that corresponds to the `name` column in the `Person` table. This relationship allows us to join these tables to get detailed information about individuals credited in the music department.  4. **Formulate the Join Condition**:    - To combine information from both tables, we perform an INNER JOIN on the `name` column from the `Person` table and the `person` column from the `Credit` table. This will allow us to match each person in the `Credit` table with their detailed information in the `Person` table.  5. **Filter for Music Department**:    - Since we are only interested in the music department, we need to filter the results of the join to include only those records where the `category` column in the `Credit` table is 'Music Department'.  6. **Select Required Columns**:    - We need to select all relevant columns from the `Person` table to provide comprehensive information about each individual. These columns are `person`, `name`, `birthdate`, `birth_name`, `birth_place`, `birth_region`, `birth_country`, `height_meters`, and `nickname`.  7. **Ensure Uniqueness**:    - Use the `DISTINCT` keyword to ensure that the results do not contain duplicate entries for individuals who may have multiple credits in the music department.  8. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Combine all the above steps to construct the SQL query:            SELECT DISTINCT person, name, birthdate, birth_name, birth_place, birth_region, birth_country, height_meters, nickname       FROM Person AS T1       INNER JOIN Credit AS T2 ON T1.name = T2.person       WHERE T2.category = 'Music Department';        By following these logical steps, we can systematically arrive at the solution to list all the information about the music department's casts and crews.",,

Here's how you can approach the problem:  1. **Understand the Schema and Problem Requirements**:     - We have two relevant tables: `Episode` and `Vote`.    - The `Episode` table contains information about each episode, including its title and season.    - The `Vote` table contains information about the number of votes each episode received for different star ratings.    - Our task is to find episodes where the number of 7-star votes exceeds the average number of 7-star votes for the season.  2. **Identify Relevant Columns**:    - From the `Episode` table, we need the `episode_id`, `season`, and `title`.    - From the `Vote` table, we need the `episode_id`, `stars`, and `votes`.  3. **Calculate the Season Average for 7-Star Votes**:    - We need to calculate the average number of 7-star votes per episode for each season.    - This involves filtering the `Vote` table to only include rows where `stars = 7`.    - Then, group the data by `episode_id` to sum the votes for each episode.    - Finally, calculate the average across all episodes in the same season.  4. **Compare Each Episode's 7-Star Votes to the Season Average**:    - For each episode, check if its 7-star votes exceed the calculated season average.    - This requires joining the `Episode` and `Vote` tables on `episode_id` to access both the episode's details and its votes.  5. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Use a subquery to calculate the season average of 7-star votes.    - Use a `WHERE` clause to filter episodes where the 7-star votes exceed this average.    - Select the `episode_id` and join with the `Episode` table to get the `title`.  6. **Ensure Distinct Results**:    - Since multiple rows in the `Vote` table can correspond to the same episode, use `DISTINCT` to ensure each episode is only listed once.  7. **Final SQL Query**:    - The final query should look like this:   SELECT DISTINCT T1.title FROM Episode AS T1 INNER JOIN Vote AS T2 ON T2.episode_id = T1.episode_id WHERE T2.stars = 7 AND T2.votes > (     SELECT AVG(votes)     FROM Vote AS V     INNER JOIN Episode AS E ON E.episode_id = V.episode_id     WHERE V.stars = 7 AND E.season = T1.season );   This query effectively filters out episodes that have more 7-star votes than the average for their respective season, and returns their titles.",,
