In the context of reviews, a bad or terrible experience is typically indicated by low star ratings.  2. **Identify Relevant Data**:    - From the schema provided, the `Reviews` table contains a `review_stars` column, which indicates the rating given by customers. This is directly related to customer experiences.    - The `Business` table contains a `stars` column, which represents the average star rating of each business based on customer reviews.  3. **Define Criteria for Bad or Terrible Experience**:    - Generally, star ratings of 1 or 2 are considered indicators of a bad or terrible experience. Therefore, we need to focus on businesses with average star ratings of 1 or 2.  4. **Determine the Table to Query**:    - Since we are interested in the number of businesses, the `Business` table is the appropriate table to query. This table provides the average star rating for each business.  5. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - We need to count the number of businesses where the average star rating is either 1 or 2.    - The SQL query to achieve this would be:            SELECT COUNT(business_id) FROM Business WHERE stars IN (1, 2);        6. **Verify the Query**:    - Ensure that the query correctly counts the businesses with average star ratings of 1 or 2.    - Double-check that the `stars` column in the `Business` table accurately reflects the average rating based on customer reviews.  By following these steps, we can logically derive the solution to the problem, ensuring that we accurately count the number of businesses where customers have had a bad or terrible experience.",,

Veracity here could be interpreted as the credibility or truthfulness of reviews, which might be inferred from the number of reviews or the star ratings.  2. **Analyze the Schema**: Review the provided schema to identify relevant tables and columns. Key tables include:    - `Business`: Contains information about businesses, including their city and review count.    - `Reviews`: Contains information about reviews, including review stars and votes.    - Other tables like `Users`, `Checkins`, etc., are less relevant for this specific problem.  3. **Identify Relevant Columns**: From the `Business` table, the relevant columns are:    - `business_id`: To uniquely identify each business.    - `city`: To filter businesses located in Paradise Valley.    - `review_count`: To determine the number of reviews, which could indicate veracity.    - `stars`: To determine the quality of reviews.  4. **Define Criteria for ""Lowest Veracity""**:     - Businesses with a low number of reviews (`review_count = 'Low'`) might indicate lower veracity since fewer reviews could mean less reliable overall ratings.    - Businesses with higher star ratings (`stars > 3`) might be considered to have more credible reviews, assuming lower star ratings might indicate dissatisfaction or unreliable reviews.  5. **Formulate the SQL Query**: Based on the above criteria, construct the SQL query:    - Filter businesses located in Paradise Valley (`city = 'Paradise Valley'`).    - Select businesses with a low review count (`review_count = 'Low'`).    - Consider businesses with star ratings greater than 3 (`stars > 3`) to ensure they are not inherently low-rated.  6. **Write the SQL Query**:        SELECT business_id     FROM Business     WHERE stars > 3       AND city = 'Paradise Valley'       AND review_count = 'Low';      7. **Validate the Solution**: Ensure the query correctly identifies businesses in Paradise Valley with low review counts and adequate star ratings, which aligns with the interpretation of ""lowest veracity"" in this context.

Here’s how you might approach the problem:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to find out how many businesses have more than one attribute. This means we are interested in counting businesses that have multiple entries in the `Business_Attributes` table.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - The `Business_Attributes` table is relevant because it contains information about the attributes associated with each business. Specifically, we are interested in the `business_id` and `attribute_id` columns.  3. **Plan the Query**:    - To determine how many businesses have more than one attribute, we need to count the number of distinct attributes associated with each business and then filter for businesses with more than one attribute.  4. **Group and Count Attributes per Business**:    - Use a `GROUP BY` clause on the `business_id` to group all entries by each business. This will allow us to count the number of attributes for each business.  5. **Filter Businesses with More Than One Attribute**:    - Use a `HAVING` clause to filter the groups where the count of `attribute_id` is greater than 1. This ensures we only consider businesses with more than one attribute.  6. **Count the Number of Such Businesses**:    - Finally, use a `COUNT` function to count the number of businesses that meet the criteria.  7. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Based on the above steps, the SQL query would look like this:            SELECT COUNT(business_id)      FROM (        SELECT business_id        FROM Business_Attributes        GROUP BY business_id        HAVING COUNT(attribute_id) > 1      ) AS subquery;        8. **Review and Validate**:    - Ensure the query logic aligns with the problem statement and that it accurately counts businesses with more than one attribute. Validate the query against sample data to ensure correctness.  By following these steps, you can logically derive the solution to the problem of counting businesses with more than one attribute.",,

Here is a breakdown of the reasoning process:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to find businesses that have consistent opening and closing hours every day of the week.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - The `Business_Hours` table is relevant because it contains information about the opening and closing times of businesses for each day of the week.    - Columns of interest are `business_id`, `day_id`, `opening_time`, and `closing_time`.  3. **Determine Criteria for Consistency**:    - A business is considered to have consistent hours if the `opening_time` and `closing_time` are the same for every day it operates.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - We need to group the data by `business_id` and check if the `opening_time` and `closing_time` are the same across all days.    - The SQL query should count distinct `business_id` entries where the `opening_time` and `closing_time` are consistent.  5. **Simplify the Problem**:    - If the problem specifies a particular time range (e.g., 8AM to 6PM), we can simplify the query by directly filtering businesses that match this time range for all days.  6. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Use a `SELECT` statement to count the number of businesses.    - Use a `WHERE` clause to filter businesses that have the same `opening_time` and `closing_time` for all days they are open.    - If the problem specifies a particular time range, include this in the `WHERE` clause.  7. **Execute and Validate the Query**:    - Ensure the query is correct by checking the logic and running it against the database to verify the results.  Based on the solution provided, the SQL query is:  SELECT COUNT(business_id)  FROM Business_Hours  WHERE opening_time = '8AM' AND closing_time = '6PM'   This query directly counts businesses that are open from 8AM to 6PM every day they operate, assuming this is the consistent time range specified in the problem.",,

Here are the logical steps to arrive at the solution:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: We need to find the count of users who have a high number of compliments and do not have any fans. This involves two conditions: a high number of compliments and zero fans.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**: From the schema, identify which tables contain the necessary information:    - `Users_Compliments`: This table contains information about the number of compliments each user has received.    - `Users`: This table contains information about users, including the number of fans they have.  3. **Determine Key Columns**: Identify the key columns needed to filter and join the tables:    - From `Users_Compliments`, we need `user_id` and `number_of_compliments`.    - From `Users`, we need `user_id` and `user_fans`.  4. **Set Conditions for Filtering**: Define the conditions based on the problem statement:    - `number_of_compliments` should be 'High'.    - `user_fans` should be 'None'.  5. **Plan the SQL Query**:    - Use an `INNER JOIN` to combine `Users_Compliments` and `Users` tables on `user_id` since we need information from both tables.    - Apply the conditions in the `WHERE` clause to filter users with a high number of compliments and no fans.  6. **Select and Aggregate the Result**:    - Use `COUNT()` to count the number of users who meet the criteria.    - Select only the `user_id` for counting, as we are interested in the number of users, not their detailed information.  7. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Combine the above steps into a structured SQL query:            SELECT COUNT(T2.user_id)      FROM Users_Compliments AS T1      INNER JOIN Users AS T2 ON T1.user_id = T2.user_id      WHERE T1.number_of_compliments = 'High' AND T2.user_fans = 'None';        8. **Verify the Solution**: Ensure the query accurately reflects the problem requirements and correctly counts the users based on the specified conditions.  By following these steps, we logically derive the solution to the problem using the provided schema and data.",,

This can be done using the `SUM()` function on the `likes` column.  5. **Rank Users by Total Likes**:    - Order the users by the total likes in descending order to identify the top users with the most likes.  6. **Select Top 3 Users**:    - Limit the results to the top 3 users who have received the most likes.  7. **Join with Users Table**:    - Perform an inner join between the aggregated results from the `Tips` table and the `Users` table on `user_id` to get the average stars for these top users.  8. **Select the Required Information**:    - Extract the `user_average_stars` for the top 3 users.  9. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Combine all the above steps into a single SQL query:            SELECT T2.user_average_stars      FROM Tips AS T1      INNER JOIN Users AS T2 ON T1.user_id = T2.user_id      GROUP BY T2.user_id      ORDER BY SUM(T1.likes) DESC      LIMIT 3;        By following these steps, we can effectively determine the average stars for each of the top 3 users with the most likes on their tips.",,

This involves identifying the business in Arcadia and then determining the categories linked to it.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**: From the schema, identify the tables that contain information about businesses, their locations, and their categories. The relevant tables are:    - `Business`: Contains information about businesses, including their city.    - `Business_Categories`: Links businesses to their categories.    - `Categories`: Contains category details.  3. **Determine the Business in Arcadia**:    - Use the `Business` table to filter out the business located in Arcadia. We need to find the `business_id` of the business where the `city` is 'Arcadia'.  4. **Link Business to Categories**:    - Once the `business_id` for the Arcadia business is identified, use the `Business_Categories` table to find all `category_id`s associated with this `business_id`.  5. **Retrieve Category Names**:    - With the `category_id`s obtained from the previous step, join with the `Categories` table to get the `category_name` for each `category_id`.  6. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Start by selecting the `category_name` from the `Categories` table.    - Use an `INNER JOIN` with the `Business_Categories` table on `category_id` to link categories to businesses.    - Further `INNER JOIN` with the `Business` table on `business_id` to filter businesses by the city 'Arcadia'.    - Ensure the `WHERE` clause specifies `T3.city = 'Arcadia'` to focus on the business in Arcadia.  7. **Write the Final Query**:    - The query should look like this:            SELECT T1.category_name      FROM Categories AS T1      INNER JOIN Business_Categories AS T2 ON T1.category_id = T2.category_id      INNER JOIN Business AS T3 ON T2.business_id = T3.business_id      WHERE T3.city = 'Arcadia';        By following these steps, we can logically derive the SQL solution to identify the categories associated with the business in Arcadia.",,

Here’s a breakdown of the reasoning process:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: We need to find businesses that are open on Sunday. This implies that we need to look for business hours that correspond to Sunday.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**: From the schema provided, we need to identify which tables contain information about business hours and the days of the week. The `Business_Hours` table contains information about business hours, and the `Days` table contains information about the days of the week.  3. **Determine the Relationship Between Tables**: The `Business_Hours` table has a `day_id` column that can be linked to the `Days` table's `day_id` column. This relationship allows us to determine which day of the week corresponds to each entry in the `Business_Hours` table.  4. **Identify the Day for Sunday**: From the `Days` table, we need to find the `day_id` that corresponds to Sunday. According to the schema, Sunday has a `day_id` of 1.  5. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - We need to select the `business_id` from the `Business_Hours` table where the `day_id` is 1 (Sunday).    - To ensure that we are accurately identifying Sunday, we can perform an INNER JOIN between the `Business_Hours` table and the `Days` table on the `day_id` column.    - The WHERE clause will filter the results to only include entries where `day_id` is 1, which corresponds to Sunday.  6. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Use the SELECT statement to retrieve the `business_id`.    - Use the INNER JOIN to connect `Business_Hours` and `Days` tables on `day_id`.    - Apply the WHERE clause to filter for `day_id = 1`.  7. **Review and Validate**: Ensure that the query correctly captures all businesses open on Sunday by checking the logic and structure of the query.  By following these steps, we arrive at the final SQL query:   SELECT T1.business_id  FROM Business_Hours AS T1  INNER JOIN Days AS T2 ON T1.day_id = T2.day_id  WHERE T1.day_id = 1;   This query will list all businesses that are open on Sunday by selecting their IDs from the `Business_Hours` table where the `day_id` matches that of Sunday.",,

This involves checking the business status and the specific attribute.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**: From the schema provided, the relevant tables are:    - `Attributes`: Contains attribute names and IDs.    - `Business_Attributes`: Links businesses with their attributes.    - `Business`: Contains business details including their active status.  3. **Determine Necessary Joins**:    - We need to join the `Attributes` table with the `Business_Attributes` table to filter businesses based on the ""music_karaoke"" attribute.    - Then, join the `Business_Attributes` table with the `Business` table to check the active status of these businesses.  4. **Filter for Specific Attribute**:    - Use the `Attributes` table to filter for the ""music_karaoke"" attribute. This involves checking the `attribute_name` column.  5. **Filter for Closed Businesses**:    - From the `Business` table, filter businesses that are closed by checking the `active` column for a value of 'false'.  6. **Consider Attribute Value Conditions**:    - The problem might imply that we are interested in businesses where the ""music_karaoke"" attribute is set to values indicating it is not available, such as 'none', 'no', or 'false'. This requires checking the `attribute_value` column in the `Business_Attributes` table.  7. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Use `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on the identified relationships.    - Apply `WHERE` conditions to filter for the ""music_karaoke"" attribute and closed businesses.    - Use `COUNT` to determine the number of businesses that meet these criteria.  8. **Write the SQL Query**:    - The final query combines all these steps into a coherent SQL statement:   SELECT COUNT(T2.business_id) FROM Attributes AS T1 INNER JOIN Business_Attributes AS T2 ON T1.attribute_id = T2.attribute_id INNER JOIN Business AS T3 ON T2.business_id = T3.business_id WHERE T1.attribute_name = 'music_karaoke' AND T3.active = 'false' AND T2.attribute_value IN ('none', 'no', 'false');   By following these logical steps, we ensure that we accurately address the problem and construct a solution that meets the requirements.",,

Then, join the `Business_Hours` table with the `Days` table on `day_id` to get the actual day of the week.    - **Filter by City**: Use a `WHERE` clause to filter businesses located in Scottsdale.    - **Filter by Day and Time**: Further filter the results to include only those entries where the `day_of_week` is Sunday and the `opening_time` is 12 PM.    - **Count Unique Businesses**: Use `COUNT(DISTINCT business_id)` to ensure we count each business only once, even if it has multiple entries for different times or days.  4. **Write the SQL Query**:    - The query is structured as follows:            SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT T2.business_id)      FROM Business AS T1      INNER JOIN Business_Hours AS T2 ON T1.business_id = T2.business_id      INNER JOIN Days AS T3 ON T2.day_id = T3.day_id      WHERE T1.city = 'Scottsdale'      AND T3.day_of_week = 'Sunday'      AND T2.opening_time = '12PM'        5. **Verify the Query**:    - Ensure that the joins are correctly linking the tables.    - Confirm that the filters correctly match the problem requirements.    - Validate that the query counts distinct businesses to avoid duplicates.  By following these steps, we ensure that the solution accurately addresses the problem using the given schema.",,

We need information about businesses, their categories, and their star ratings.    - The `Business` table contains `business_id` and `stars`.    - The `Business_Categories` table links `business_id` with `category_id`.    - The `Categories` table contains `category_id` and `category_name`.  2. **Identify the Relationships**:    - Recognize that to find businesses in a specific category, we need to join the `Business` table with the `Business_Categories` table using `business_id`.    - Further, join the result with the `Categories` table using `category_id` to filter by the category name.  3. **Filter by Category**:    - Use the `Categories` table to filter for the category name ""Obstetricians & Gynecologists"". This requires a `WHERE` clause in the SQL query.  4. **Calculate the Average Stars**:    - Once we have the businesses filtered by the desired category, calculate the average number of stars.    - Use the `SUM` function to get the total stars for these businesses.    - Use the `COUNT` function to get the number of businesses in this category.    - Divide the total stars by the number of businesses to get the average.  5. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Use `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on the relationships identified.    - Use the `WHERE` clause to filter for the specific category.    - Calculate the average using `SUM` and `COUNT`, and ensure the division results in a real number by casting the sum to `REAL`.  6. **Review and Optimize**:    - Ensure that the query is efficient and correctly joins the necessary tables.    - Double-check that the filtering and calculations are accurate.  By following these logical steps, we can construct the SQL query to solve the problem:   SELECT CAST(SUM(T1.stars) AS REAL) / COUNT(T1.business_id)  FROM Business AS T1  INNER JOIN Business_Categories AS T2 ON T1.business_id = T2.business_id  INNER JOIN Categories AS T3 ON T2.category_id = T3.category_id  WHERE T3.category_name = 'Obstetricians & Gynecologists';   This query will return the average number of stars for businesses in the ""Obstetricians & Gynecologists"" category.",,

We need the `user_id` and `year_id` columns.    - **Years Table**: This table helps us map `year_id` to `actual_year`. We need the `year_id` and `actual_year` columns.    - **Users Table**: This table contains user information, including the number of fans. We need the `user_id` and `user_fans` columns.  3. **Filter for the Year 2011**:    - Use the `Years` table to filter for the `actual_year` 2011. This will give us the corresponding `year_id`.  4. **Join Tables to Gather Required Data**:    - **Join `Elite` and `Years` Tables**: Join these tables on `year_id` to filter users who were elite in 2011.    - **Join Result with `Users` Table**: Join the result with the `Users` table on `user_id` to get the fan count for each elite user in 2011.  5. **Calculate the Percentage**:    - **Count Total Elite Users in 2011**: Use `COUNT(T3.user_fans)` to get the total number of elite users in 2011.    - **Count Elite Users with High Fans**: Use `SUM(CASE WHEN T3.user_fans = 'High' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)` to count how many of these users had a high number of fans.    - **Calculate Percentage**: Divide the count of elite users with high fans by the total count of elite users in 2011 and multiply by 100 to get the percentage.  6. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Use `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on the identified relationships.    - Use `WHERE` clause to filter for the year 2011.    - Use `CASE` statement within `SUM` to count users with high fans.    - Use `CAST` to ensure the division results in a real number for percentage calculation.

By following these steps, we can logically derive the solution to the SQL problem using the given schema and requirements.",,

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement:**    - We need to list business IDs that have a star rating between 3 and 5 and are located in Chandler.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns:**    - From the schema provided, the `Business` table contains information about businesses, including their `business_id`, `stars`, and `city`.    - These columns are crucial because they directly relate to the conditions specified in the problem statement.  3. **Determine the Conditions to Apply:**    - We need to filter businesses based on two conditions:      - The star rating should be between 3 and 5. This translates to `stars >= 3 AND stars < 6` in SQL.      - The city should be Chandler, which translates to `city = 'Chandler'` in SQL.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query:**    - With the identified conditions and relevant table, we can construct the SQL query.    - We need to select the `business_id` from the `Business` table where both conditions are satisfied.  5. **Write the SQL Query:**    - The SQL query should select the `business_id` from the `Business` table where the `stars` are within the specified range and the `city` is Chandler.    - The query is:             SELECT business_id       FROM Business       WHERE stars >= 3 AND stars < 6 AND city = 'Chandler';        6. **Verify the Solution:**    - Ensure that the query correctly implements the conditions specified in the problem statement.    - Check that the query uses the correct table and columns.

This means the year should be greater than or equal to 2009 and less than 2012.  4. **Filter Users Based on Fan Count**:    - Among the filtered users, we need to further filter those who have a `user_fans` value of 'Low'.  5. **Count the Number of Users**:    - After applying the above filters, we need to count the number of users that meet both criteria.  6. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Use the `SELECT COUNT(user_id)` to count the number of users.    - Use the `WHERE` clause to apply the filters for `user_yelping_since_year` and `user_fans`.  7. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Combine all the above steps into a single SQL query:            SELECT COUNT(user_id)       FROM Users       WHERE user_yelping_since_year >= 2009         AND user_yelping_since_year < 2012         AND user_fans = 'Low';        By following these steps, we can logically derive the solution to the problem using the given schema and requirements.",,

Here are the logical steps to arrive at the solution:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: We need to count businesses that are categorized under ""Food"" and have a star rating of less than 3.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - We need information about businesses, their categories, and their star ratings.    - The relevant tables are:      - `Business`: Contains `business_id` and `stars`.      - `Business_Categories`: Contains `business_id` and `category_id`.      - `Categories`: Contains `category_id` and `category_name`.  3. **Establish Relationships Between Tables**:    - The `Business` table can be linked to the `Business_Categories` table via `business_id`.    - The `Business_Categories` table can be linked to the `Categories` table via `category_id`.  4. **Filter for the ""Food"" Category**:    - Use the `Categories` table to filter businesses that belong to the ""Food"" category. This requires a condition on `category_name`.  5. **Filter for Star Rating Below 3**:    - Use the `Business` table to filter businesses with a star rating below 3. This requires a condition on `stars`.  6. **Join Tables to Combine Information**:    - Perform an INNER JOIN between `Business` and `Business_Categories` on `business_id` to get the categories for each business.    - Perform another INNER JOIN between `Business_Categories` and `Categories` on `category_id` to get the category names.  7. **Apply Filters in the WHERE Clause**:    - Add a condition to the WHERE clause to filter for `category_name = 'Food'`.    - Add another condition to filter for `stars < 3`.  8. **Count Distinct Businesses**:    - Use the `COUNT(DISTINCT business_id)` function to count the number of unique businesses that meet the criteria.  9. **Write the Final SQL Query**:    - Combine all the steps into a single SQL query:            SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT T1.business_id)      FROM Business AS T1      INNER JOIN Business_Categories AS T2 ON T1.business_id = T2.business_id      INNER JOIN Categories AS T3 ON T2.category_id = T3.category_id      WHERE T3.category_name = 'Food' AND T1.stars < 3;        By following these logical steps, we ensure that the solution accurately addresses the problem statement using the given schema.",,

This requires accessing information about businesses, their categories, and their attributes.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**:     - The `Business` table contains information about businesses, including their star ratings.    - The `Business_Categories` table links businesses to their categories.    - The `Categories` table provides the names of these categories.    - The `Business_Attributes` table links businesses to their attributes.    - The `Attributes` table provides the names of these attributes.  3. **Determine the Highest Star Rating**:     - Use the `Business` table to find the maximum star rating among all businesses. This can be achieved using an aggregate function like `MAX()`.  4. **Filter Businesses by Highest Star Rating**:    - Use a subquery to filter businesses that have the highest star rating. This involves selecting businesses from the `Business` table where the `stars` column matches the maximum value found in the previous step.  5. **Join Tables to Gather Required Information**:    - Join the `Business` table with the `Business_Categories` table on `business_id` to associate each business with its categories.    - Further join with the `Categories` table on `category_id` to get the category names.    - Similarly, join the `Business` table with the `Business_Attributes` table on `business_id` to associate each business with its attributes.    - Finally, join with the `Attributes` table on `attribute_id` to get the attribute names.  6. **Select Distinct Results**:    - Use `SELECT DISTINCT` to ensure that the results do not contain duplicate entries for category and attribute combinations.  7. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Combine all the above steps into a single SQL query that selects distinct category names and attribute names for businesses with the highest star rating.  By following these steps, you can construct the SQL query that effectively retrieves the desired information about the categories and attributes of businesses with the highest star rating.",,

Here are the logical steps to reach the solution:  1. **Understand the Problem Requirements**:     - We need to find the category of a business.    - The business must have the shortest review length and the highest review stars.    - The business ID must be between 7 and 14, inclusive.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - **Reviews Table**: Contains `business_id`, `review_length`, and `review_stars`.    - **Business_Categories Table**: Links `business_id` with `category_id`.    - **Categories Table**: Maps `category_id` to `category_name`.  3. **Filter Businesses by ID**:    - We need to consider only businesses with IDs between 7 and 14. This can be done using a WHERE clause on the `business_id` in the `Business_Categories` table.  4. **Filter Reviews by Short Review Length**:    - From the `Reviews` table, filter reviews where `review_length` is 'Short'.  5. **Determine the Highest Review Stars**:    - Identify the maximum value of `review_stars` from the `Reviews` table. This requires a subquery to find the maximum review stars.  6. **Join Tables to Get Category Information**:    - Use an INNER JOIN to connect the `Reviews` table with the `Business_Categories` table on `business_id`.    - Further, join the `Business_Categories` table with the `Categories` table on `category_id` to get the `category_name`.  7. **Combine Conditions**:    - Ensure that the business ID is within the specified range.    - Ensure that the review length is 'Short'.    - Ensure that the review stars match the maximum review stars found in the subquery.  8. **Select Distinct Category Name**:    - Since a business can belong to multiple categories, use `SELECT DISTINCT` to ensure that each category name is listed only once.  9. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Combine all the above steps into a coherent SQL query that retrieves the desired category name.  Here is the SQL query based on the above reasoning:   SELECT DISTINCT T3.category_name  FROM Reviews AS T1  INNER JOIN Business_Categories AS T2 ON T1.business_id = T2.business_id  INNER JOIN Categories AS T3 ON T2.category_id = T3.category_id  WHERE T2.business_id >= 7 AND T2.business_id < 15  AND T1.review_length = 'Short'  AND T1.review_stars = (     SELECT MAX(review_stars)      FROM Reviews );   This query effectively filters and joins the necessary tables to find the category of the business with the shortest review length and highest review stars within the specified business ID range.",,

By following these steps, we ensure that we accurately count the businesses that meet all specified conditions.

The `Business` table contains information about businesses, including their location (`city`) and star rating (`stars`). The `Business_Hours` table contains the opening and closing times of businesses.  2. **Identify the Target City**:    - The problem specifies that we are interested in businesses located in Glendale. Therefore, we need to filter businesses based on the `city` column in the `Business` table.  3. **Determine the Highest Star Rating**:    - We need to find businesses with the highest star rating. This involves ordering the businesses by the `stars` column in descending order.  4. **Join Relevant Tables**:    - To get the opening and closing times, we need to join the `Business` table with the `Business_Hours` table. The common column for joining these tables is `business_id`.  5. **Select Required Information**:    - After joining the tables, we need to select the `opening_time` and `closing_time` columns from the `Business_Hours` table.  6. **Apply Filters and Sorting**:    - Filter the results to include only businesses located in Glendale (`WHERE T1.city = 'Glendale'`).    - Sort the results by star rating in descending order to ensure that the business with the highest rating appears first (`ORDER BY T1.stars DESC`).  7. **Limit the Result**:    - Since we are only interested in the business with the highest star rating, we limit the result to one record (`LIMIT 1`).  8. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Combine all the steps into a single SQL query:            SELECT T2.opening_time, T2.closing_time       FROM Business AS T1       INNER JOIN Business_Hours AS T2       ON T1.business_id = T2.business_id       WHERE T1.city = 'Glendale'       ORDER BY T1.stars DESC       LIMIT 1        By following these logical steps, we can construct a query that retrieves the opening and closing times of the highest-rated business in Glendale.",,

Here’s a breakdown of the thought process:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: We need to list categories of businesses that are active and located in Glendale, AZ. This means we need to filter businesses based on their active status and location.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**:     - The `Business` table contains information about each business, including whether it is active, its city, and state. This table is crucial for filtering businesses based on activity status and location.    - The `Business_Categories` table links businesses to their respective categories, which is essential for identifying the categories of the businesses.    - The `Categories` table provides the names of the categories, which we need to display in the final result.  3. **Determine Necessary Joins**:    - To get the category names for businesses, we need to join the `Business_Categories` table with the `Categories` table using the `category_id`.    - To filter businesses based on activity and location, we need to join the `Business_Categories` table with the `Business` table using the `business_id`.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Start by selecting distinct category names because we only want to list each category once, even if multiple businesses belong to the same category.    - Use an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Business_Categories` and `Business` tables on `business_id` to filter businesses that are active and located in Glendale, AZ.    - Use another `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Business_Categories` and `Categories` tables on `category_id` to get the category names.    - Apply the `WHERE` clause to filter businesses that are active (`T2.active = 'true'`), located in Glendale (`T2.city = 'Glendale'`), and in Arizona (`T2.state = 'AZ'`).  5. **Write the Final Query**:        SELECT DISTINCT T3.category_name     FROM Business_Categories AS T1     INNER JOIN Business AS T2 ON T1.business_id = T2.business_id     INNER JOIN Categories AS T3 ON T1.category_id = T3.category_id     WHERE T2.active = 'true'     AND T2.state = 'AZ'     AND T2.city = 'Glendale';      By following these steps, we ensure that the query accurately retrieves the desired information about the categories of active businesses in Glendale, AZ.",,

This requires identifying businesses with specific operating hours on a specific day.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**: Based on the schema provided, the relevant tables for this problem are:    - `Business`: Contains information about businesses, including their city.    - `Business_Hours`: Contains information about the operating hours of businesses on different days.    - `Days`: Maps day IDs to the actual days of the week.  3. **Determine Necessary Columns**:    - From the `Business` table, we need the `city` column to determine the location.    - From the `Business_Hours` table, we need `business_id`, `day_id`, `opening_time`, and `closing_time` to filter businesses based on their operating hours.    - From the `Days` table, we need `day_id` and `day_of_week` to identify Wednesdays.  4. **Plan the SQL Query**:    - **Join Tables**: We need to join the `Business`, `Business_Hours`, and `Days` tables to combine the necessary information:      - Join `Business` and `Business_Hours` on `business_id` to link businesses with their operating hours.      - Join `Business_Hours` and `Days` on `day_id` to map the day of the week to the operating hours.        - **Filter Conditions**: Apply conditions to filter businesses that are open from 7 am to 7 pm on Wednesdays:      - Check that `opening_time` is '7AM' and `closing_time` is '7PM'.      - Ensure `day_of_week` is 'Wednesday'.  5. **Select and Distinct**: Since we are interested in the unique locations (cities) of these businesses, use `SELECT DISTINCT` to retrieve unique city names.  6. **Write the SQL Query**:    - The final query should look like this:            SELECT DISTINCT T1.city      FROM Business AS T1      INNER JOIN Business_Hours AS T2 ON T1.business_id = T2.business_id      INNER JOIN Days AS T3 ON T2.day_id = T3.day_id      WHERE T2.opening_time = '7AM'      AND T2.closing_time = '7PM'      AND T3.day_of_week = 'Wednesday';        7. **Verify the Solution**: Ensure that the query correctly identifies businesses with the specified operating hours on Wednesdays and returns the correct city names.

Here is how the SQL query is constructed:   SELECT DISTINCT T2.opening_time FROM Business AS T1 INNER JOIN Business_Hours AS T2 ON T1.business_id = T2.business_id WHERE T1.city = 'Glendale'   AND T1.review_count = 'Medium'   AND T1.active = 'true';   This query joins the `Business` and `Business_Hours` tables on `business_id`, filters for businesses in Glendale with a medium review count that are active, and selects the distinct opening times.",,

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logical reasoning process to arrive at the solution:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement:**    - We need to calculate the percentage of businesses categorized under ""Food"" that have a star rating greater than 3.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns:**    - From the schema, the relevant tables are:      - `Business`: Contains business information, including `business_id` and `stars`.      - `Business_Categories`: Links businesses to their categories via `business_id` and `category_id`.      - `Categories`: Contains category information, including `category_id` and `category_name`.  3. **Determine the Necessary Joins:**    - To filter businesses by the ""Food"" category, we need to join the `Business`, `Business_Categories`, and `Categories` tables:      - Join `Business` and `Business_Categories` on `business_id` to associate businesses with their categories.      - Join `Business_Categories` and `Categories` on `category_id` to access the category names.  4. **Filter for the ""Food"" Category:**    - Use a `WHERE` clause to filter the results to only include rows where `category_name` is ""Food"".  5. **Calculate the Percentage:**    - Use a `CASE` statement to count businesses with more than 3 stars.    - Calculate the total number of businesses in the ""Food"" category.    - Compute the percentage by dividing the count of businesses with more than 3 stars by the total count of businesses in the ""Food"" category and multiplying by 100.  6. **Write the SQL Query:**    - Use `SUM` and `COUNT` to perform the necessary calculations.    - Convert the result to a real number to ensure proper division and percentage calculation.  7. **Construct the Final Query:**    - Combine all the steps into a single SQL query:            SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN T1.stars > 3 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(T1.stars)      FROM Business AS T1      INNER JOIN Business_Categories AS T2 ON T1.business_id = T2.business_id      INNER JOIN Categories AS T3 ON T2.category_id = T3.category_id      WHERE T3.category_name = 'Food'        By following these steps, we ensure that the query accurately calculates the desired percentage by leveraging the relationships between the tables and applying the necessary filtering and aggregation functions.",,

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to list the closing time and day of the week for active businesses in Goodyear.    - The businesses should have a star rating greater than 80% of the average star rating of all active businesses in Goodyear.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - From the `Business` table, we need to filter businesses based on `active`, `city`, and `stars` columns.    - The `Business_Hours` table provides `closing_time` and links to the `day_id`.    - The `Days` table provides the `day_of_week` corresponding to `day_id`.  3. **Filter Active Businesses in Goodyear**:    - Use the `Business` table to filter businesses where `active = 'true'` and `city = 'Goodyear'`.  4. **Calculate 80% of Average Star Rating**:    - Compute the average star rating of active businesses in Goodyear using a subquery.    - Multiply this average by 0.8 to get the threshold for star ratings.  5. **Filter Businesses with Stars Above Threshold**:    - Use the result from the subquery to filter businesses with `stars` greater than the calculated threshold.  6. **Join Tables to Get Required Information**:    - Join the `Business` table with `Business_Hours` on `business_id` to get `closing_time`.    - Further, join with the `Days` table on `day_id` to get `day_of_week`.  7. **Select and Distinct**:    - Select `closing_time` and `day_of_week` from the joined tables.    - Use `DISTINCT` to ensure unique combinations of closing time and day of the week.  8. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Combine the above steps into a coherent SQL query.  Here's the SQL query based on the above reasoning:   SELECT DISTINCT T2.closing_time, T3.day_of_week  FROM Business AS T1  INNER JOIN Business_Hours AS T2 ON T1.business_id = T2.business_id  INNER JOIN Days AS T3 ON T2.day_id = T3.day_id  WHERE T1.active = 'true'  AND T1.city = 'Goodyear'  AND T1.stars > (     SELECT AVG(stars) * 0.8      FROM Business      WHERE active = 'true'      AND city = 'Goodyear' );   This query effectively retrieves the closing times and corresponding days of the week for businesses in Goodyear that meet the specified criteria.",,

Here are the logical steps to reach the solution:  1. **Understand the Schema and Problem Statement**:     - We have three tables: `cites`, `paper`, and `content`.    - The `paper` table contains `paper_id` and `class_label`, which tells us the classification of each paper.    - The problem asks for the percentage of papers classified as ""Agents"" among all cited papers.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - The `paper` table is crucial because it contains the classification (`class_label`) of each paper.    - We need to focus on `paper_id` from the `paper` table to identify which papers are cited.  3. **Determine the Total Number of Cited Papers**:    - Since the problem is about cited papers, we need to consider all papers listed in the `paper` table, as it seems to represent all papers that could potentially be cited.  4. **Filter Papers Classified as ""Agents""**:    - We need to count the number of papers with the `class_label` ""Agents"". This can be done using a conditional count.  5. **Calculate the Percentage**:    - To find the percentage, divide the number of ""Agents"" papers by the total number of papers and multiply by 100.  6. **Translate the Logic into SQL**:    - Use a `SELECT` statement to perform the calculations.    - Use a `CASE` statement within `COUNT` to conditionally count only those papers with the `class_label` ""Agents"".    - Convert the count to a real number to ensure accurate division and percentage calculation.  7. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - The SQL query should count the total number of papers and the number of ""Agents"" papers, then calculate the percentage.  By following these steps, we can construct the SQL query that solves the problem:   SELECT CAST(COUNT(CASE WHEN class_label = 'Agents' THEN paper_id ELSE NULL END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(paper_id) FROM paper   This query calculates the percentage of papers classified as ""Agents"" among all papers listed in the `paper` table.",,

This can be achieved by counting `word_cited_id` entries for each `paper_id` in the `content` table.    - After counting, we need to identify the paper with the highest count of cited words.    - Finally, we need to retrieve the class label for this paper from the `paper` table.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Start by joining the `paper` and `content` tables on `paper_id` to combine the information needed.    - Use the `COUNT` function to count the number of `word_cited_id` entries for each `paper_id`.    - Group the results by `paper_id` and `class_label` to ensure we count citations for each paper and can retrieve the class label.    - Order the results by the count in descending order to bring the paper with the most citations to the top.    - Use `LIMIT 1` to select only the top result, which is the paper with the most cited words.  5. **Write the SQL Query**:    - The query is constructed as follows:            SELECT T1.paper_id, T1.class_label      FROM paper AS T1      INNER JOIN content AS T2 ON T1.paper_id = T2.paper_id      GROUP BY T1.paper_id, T1.class_label      ORDER BY COUNT(T2.word_cited_id) DESC      LIMIT 1;        6. **Verify the Query**:    - Ensure that the query correctly joins the tables, groups the data, counts the citations, and orders the results to find the paper with the most cited words.    - Confirm that the query retrieves both the `paper_id` and `class_label` for the paper with the highest citation count.

Here's how we can break down the process:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: We need to calculate the average number of papers classified under the ""ML"" (Machine Learning) category. The problem is asking for an average, which implies a division of some count by another count.  2. **Examine the Schema**: We have three tables: `cites`, `paper`, and `content`. The relevant table for this problem is the `paper` table because it contains the `class_label` column, which indicates the classification of each paper.  3. **Identify Relevant Columns**: From the `paper` table, the `class_label` column tells us the category of each paper, and the `paper_id` column uniquely identifies each paper. We need to focus on these columns to determine how many papers belong to the ""ML"" class.  4. **Count Papers with 'ML' Class**: We need to count how many papers have the `class_label` set to 'ML'. This can be done using a conditional count, where we only count the `paper_id` if the `class_label` is 'ML'.  5. **Count Total Papers**: To find the average, we also need the total number of papers in the `paper` table. This is simply a count of all `paper_id` entries in the table.  6. **Calculate the Average**: The average number of papers under the ML class is the count of ML papers divided by the total count of papers. This is a straightforward division operation.  7. **Write the SQL Query**: Combine the above logic into a SQL query. Use a `CASE` statement to conditionally count only those papers with the `class_label` 'ML'. Then divide this count by the total count of papers. Ensure the division results in a real number by casting appropriately.  8. **Solution**: The final SQL query is:        SELECT CAST(COUNT(CASE WHEN class_label = 'ML' THEN paper_id ELSE NULL END) AS REAL) / COUNT(paper_id) FROM paper      This query effectively calculates the average number of papers classified under ""ML"" by dividing the count of ML papers by the total number of papers.",,

This means we need to identify individuals who worked on the show during its 20th season and determine which of them has the earliest birthdate.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - We need information about the crew members, which is likely stored in the `Person` table. The relevant columns here are `name` and `birthdate`.    - We also need to ensure that these individuals are associated with the Simpson 20s. This information might be in the `Credit` table, which links people to specific episodes via the `episode_id` and `person` columns.  3. **Filter for Relevant Season**:    - Since we are interested in the Simpson 20s, we need to ensure that the crew members worked on episodes from season 20. We can use the `Credit` table to find people credited for episodes in this season.    - However, since the problem doesn't specify filtering by season in the solution, we assume that all people in the `Person` table are relevant or that the filtering is implicit.  4. **Handle Missing Data**:    - We need to consider only those crew members whose birthdates are known. This means filtering out any entries in the `Person` table where `birthdate` is `NULL`.  5. **Sort and Select**:    - To find the oldest crew member, we need to sort the remaining entries by `birthdate` in ascending order. The earliest date will correspond to the oldest person.    - We then select the top entry from this sorted list, which gives us the name of the oldest crew member.  6. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Based on the above steps, the SQL query is constructed to select the `name` from the `Person` table where `birthdate` is not null, ordered by `birthdate` in ascending order, and limited to the first result.  By following these steps, we arrive at the solution:   SELECT name FROM Person WHERE birthdate IS NOT NULL ORDER BY birthdate ASC LIMIT 1;   This query effectively identifies the oldest crew member by leveraging the available data in the `Person` table, focusing on birthdates and ensuring only valid entries are considered.",,

The `Person` table is the most relevant as it contains columns like `name` and `nickname`.  3. **Examine the `Person` Table**:    - Look at the columns in the `Person` table: `name`, `birthdate`, `birth_name`, `birth_place`, `birth_region`, `birth_country`, `height_meters`, and `nickname`.    - The `name` column will help us locate Dan Castellaneta, and the `nickname` column will provide the information we need.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - To find the nickname of Dan Castellaneta, we need to filter the `Person` table by the `name` column.    - The SQL query should select the `nickname` column where the `name` is 'Dan Castellaneta'.  5. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Based on the above understanding, the SQL query would be:            SELECT nickname FROM Person WHERE name = 'Dan Castellaneta';        6. **Verify the Query**:    - Ensure that the query correctly targets the `Person` table and filters by the correct `name`.    - Confirm that the query selects the `nickname` column, which is the required information.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logical reasoning process to arrive at the solution:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to count the number of crew members (people involved in the production) of the Simpson 20s.    - These crew members must have been born in New York City.    - Additionally, they should have been born after the year 1970.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - The `Person` table is relevant because it contains information about individuals, including their birth details.    - Columns of interest in the `Person` table are `name`, `birthdate`, and `birth_region`.  3. **Filter by Birth Region**:    - We need to filter the records to only include those where the `birth_region` is 'New York'. This will help us identify individuals born in New York City.  4. **Filter by Birth Year**:    - We need to further filter these records to include only those born after 1970.    - The `birthdate` column is in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD'. We can extract the year using the `SUBSTR` function to get the first four characters of the `birthdate`.  5. **Count the Number of Records**:    - After applying the above filters, we need to count the number of individuals that meet both criteria.    - The `COUNT` function will be used to count the number of names that satisfy the conditions.  6. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Combine the above steps into a single SQL query:            SELECT COUNT(name)       FROM Person       WHERE birth_region = 'New York'       AND SUBSTR(birthdate, 1, 4) > '1970';        7. **Verify the Solution**:    - Ensure that the query correctly implements the logic by checking if it filters by the correct birth region and year.    - Verify that the `COUNT` function is used correctly to return the number of matching records.

This involves linking information about awards with personal details of the winners.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - **Award Table**: This table contains information about various awards, including the award category, the person who received the award, and the year of the award.

Here's a breakdown of the thought process:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: We need to find the names of all awards won by a crew member whose nickname is ""Doofus.""  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**:     - The `Person` table contains information about crew members, including their nicknames.    - The `Award` table contains information about awards, including the person who won the award and the award name.  3. **Determine the Necessary Columns**:    - From the `Person` table, we need the `nickname` and `name` columns to identify the person with the nickname ""Doofus.""    - From the `Award` table, we need the `award` and `person` columns to find the awards won by the identified person.  4. **Establish the Relationship Between Tables**:    - The `Person` table and the `Award` table are related through the `name` column in `Person` and the `person` column in `Award`. This relationship allows us to join these tables.  5. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Use an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Person` and `Award` tables based on the matching `name` and `person` columns.    - Filter the results to include only the person with the nickname ""Doofus"" using a `WHERE` clause.    - Further filter the results to include only awards where the result is ""Winner.""  6. **Select the Desired Output**:    - Select the `award` column from the `Award` table, as this is the information we need to list.  7. **Write the SQL Query**:    - The final SQL query is:            SELECT T2.award       FROM Person AS T1       INNER JOIN Award AS T2       ON T1.name = T2.person       WHERE T1.nickname = 'Doofus'       AND T2.result = 'Winner';        By following these logical steps, we can systematically approach the problem and construct a query that retrieves the desired information.",,

The award is ""Outstanding Voice-Over Performance,"" and the year is 2009.  2. **Analyze the Schema**: Review the provided schema to identify relevant tables and columns:    - **Award Table**: Contains information about awards, including the award name, year, person, and result.    - **Character_Award Table**: Links awards to characters, with columns for award_id and character.  3. **Identify Relevant Data**:    - From the **Award Table**, we need to filter rows where the `award` is ""Outstanding Voice-Over Performance,"" the `year` is 2009, and the `result` is ""Winner.""    - From the **Character_Award Table**, we need to find the character associated with the award_id that matches the criteria from the Award Table.  4. **Formulate the Query**:    - **Join the Tables**: Use an INNER JOIN between the Character_Award and Award tables on the `award_id` to link characters to their respective awards.    - **Apply Filters**: Add WHERE conditions to filter for the specific award, year, and result.    - **Select the Desired Output**: Choose the `character` column from the Character_Award table as the output.  5. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Use the SELECT statement to retrieve the distinct character names.    - Use INNER JOIN to combine the Character_Award and Award tables based on the `award_id`.    - Apply the WHERE clause to filter by award name, year, and result.  6. **Ensure Uniqueness**: Use DISTINCT in the SELECT statement to ensure that the result is unique, in case multiple entries exist for the same character.  7. **Execute and Validate**: Run the query to ensure it returns the correct character name(s) that won the award in 2009.  By following these steps, we arrive at the solution:   SELECT DISTINCT T1.character FROM Character_Award AS T1 INNER JOIN Award AS T2 ON T1.award_id = T2.award_id WHERE T2.award = 'Outstanding Voice-Over Performance' AND T2.year = 2009 AND T2.result = 'Winner';   This query effectively retrieves the character that won the specified award in the given year.",,

This requires identifying the correct episode in the database and retrieving its keywords.  2. **Examine the Schema**: Review the provided schema to understand the structure of the tables and the relationships between them. The relevant tables for this problem are `Episode` and `Keyword`.  3. **Identify Relevant Columns**:    - From the `Episode` table, the columns of interest are `episode_id` and `title`. The `episode_id` will help us uniquely identify the episode, and `title` is used to find the specific episode ""Lost Verizon.""    - From the `Keyword` table, the columns of interest are `episode_id` and `keyword`. The `episode_id` will be used to join with the `Episode` table, and `keyword` is the data we want to retrieve.  4. **Determine the Relationship**: The `Keyword` table has a foreign key relationship with the `Episode` table through the `episode_id` column. This relationship allows us to join these tables to find keywords for a specific episode.  5. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Use an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Episode` and `Keyword` tables based on the `episode_id`.    - Set a condition in the `WHERE` clause to filter the episode with the title ""Lost Verizon.""    - Select the `keyword` column from the `Keyword` table to get the desired output.  6. **Write the SQL Query**:    - The SQL query is constructed as follows:            SELECT T2.keyword      FROM Episode AS T1      INNER JOIN Keyword AS T2 ON T1.episode_id = T2.episode_id      WHERE T1.title = 'Lost Verizon';          - This query joins the `Episode` table (`T1`) with the `Keyword` table (`T2`) using the `episode_id`. It filters the results to only include the episode titled ""Lost Verizon"" and selects the `keyword` column from the `Keyword` table.  7. **Verify the Query**: Ensure that the query correctly retrieves all keywords associated with the episode ""Lost Verizon"" by checking it against the schema and sample data.

Here's how one might approach the problem:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement:**    - We need to find the titles of episodes that have received more than 200 votes with a star score of 10.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns:**    - We have two relevant tables: `Episode` and `Vote`.    - From the `Episode` table, we need the `title` column.    - From the `Vote` table, we need the `votes` and `stars` columns, and we need to filter where `stars` is 10 and `votes` is greater than 200.  3. **Determine the Relationship Between Tables:**    - Both tables have a common column `episode_id`, which can be used to join them.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query:**    - Start by selecting the `title` from the `Episode` table.    - Use an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Episode` and `Vote` tables on the `episode_id` column.    - Apply the necessary conditions in the `WHERE` clause to filter rows where `stars` is 10 and `votes` is greater than 200.  5. **Construct the SQL Query:**    - The query should look like this:            SELECT T1.title      FROM Episode AS T1      INNER JOIN Vote AS T2 ON T2.episode_id = T1.episode_id      WHERE T2.votes > 200 AND T2.stars = 10;        6. **Verify the Query:**    - Ensure the query logic aligns with the problem statement.    - Check that the join condition correctly links the tables and that the `WHERE` clause accurately filters the desired results.

This involves using the ratings data from the `Vote` table and linking it to the specific episode in the `Episode` table.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - The `Episode` table contains information about each episode, including its title.    - The `Vote` table contains voting data for each episode, including the number of stars and the number of votes for each star rating.  3. **Determine the Relationship Between Tables**:    - The `Episode` table has a primary key `episode_id` which can be used to join with the `Vote` table's `episode_id` to link votes to specific episodes.  4. **Filter for the Specific Episode**:    - We need to filter the `Episode` table to find the row where the `title` is ""Lost Verizon.""  5. **Calculate the Weighted Average of Stars**:    - For each star rating in the `Vote` table, calculate the contribution to the total by multiplying the `stars` by the `votes` for that star rating.    - Sum these contributions to get the total weighted stars.    - Sum the total number of votes for the episode to get the total votes.  6. **Compute the Average**:    - Divide the total weighted stars by the total number of votes to get the average star rating.  7. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Use an `INNER JOIN` to link the `Episode` and `Vote` tables on `episode_id`.    - Use a `WHERE` clause to filter for the episode titled ""Lost Verizon.""    - Use `SUM` and arithmetic operations to calculate the weighted average of stars.  8. **Ensure Correct Data Types**:    - Cast the result of the division to a `REAL` type to ensure a floating-point result, which represents the average accurately.  By following these steps, we can construct the SQL query:   SELECT CAST(SUM(T2.votes * T2.stars) AS REAL) / SUM(T2.votes) FROM Episode AS T1 INNER JOIN Vote AS T2 ON T2.episode_id = T1.episode_id WHERE T1.title = 'Lost Verizon';   This query calculates the average star rating for the episode ""Lost Verizon"" by joining the relevant data, filtering for the specific episode, and computing the weighted average based on the votes and star ratings.",,

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logical reasoning to arrive at the solution:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: Clearly understand that we need to find roles of a specific person (Matt Groening) for a specific episode and also retrieve the episode number and series number.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - The `Episode` table contains information about episodes, including the title, episode number, and series number.    - The `Credit` table contains information about the roles of people in different episodes, including the person's name and their role.  3. **Determine the Relationships**:    - The `Episode` table and the `Credit` table can be linked through the `episode_id` column, which is common to both tables.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Start by selecting the columns required in the output: `role` from the `Credit` table, and `episode` and `number_in_series` from the `Episode` table.    - Use an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Episode` and `Credit` tables on the `episode_id` column to ensure we only get records where there is a match in both tables.  5. **Apply Filters**:    - Filter the results to include only those records where the `person` column in the `Credit` table is 'Matt Groening'.    - Additionally, filter the results to include only the episode titled 'In the Name of the Grandfather' by using the `title` column in the `Episode` table.  6. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Combine the above steps into a coherent SQL query:            SELECT T2.role, T1.episode, T1.number_in_series      FROM Episode AS T1      INNER JOIN Credit AS T2 ON T1.episode_id = T2.episode_id      WHERE T2.person = 'Matt Groening' AND T1.title = 'In the Name of the Grandfather';        7. **Verify the Solution**:    - Ensure that the query correctly retrieves the desired information by checking the logic and syntax, ensuring it aligns with the problem requirements.  By following these steps, we can systematically approach and solve the SQL problem, ensuring that all necessary conditions are met and the correct data is retrieved.",,

Here is a breakdown of the reasoning process:  1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to find the birth name of the person who voiced the character 'Helen Lovejoy'. This requires identifying the person associated with this role and then retrieving their birth name.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**: From the schema, the tables that are likely to be relevant to this problem are:    - `Person`: Contains information about people, including their birth names.    - `Credit`: Contains information about the roles people have played or contributed to, including voice roles.  3. **Determine the Relationship Between Tables**:     - The `Credit` table has a `role` column, which can be used to find the specific role of 'Helen Lovejoy'.    - The `Credit` table also has a `person` column, which can be linked to the `name` column in the `Person` table to find the birth name.  4. **Formulate the Query**:    - We need to perform a join operation between the `Person` and `Credit` tables. The join will be based on matching the `name` column in the `Person` table with the `person` column in the `Credit` table.    - We need to filter the results to only include rows where the `role` in the `Credit` table is 'Helen Lovejoy'.    - Finally, we need to select the `birth_name` from the `Person` table for the person who voiced 'Helen Lovejoy'.  5. **Write the SQL Query**: Based on the above steps, the SQL query would be:        SELECT DISTINCT T1.birth_name    FROM Person AS T1    INNER JOIN Credit AS T2 ON T1.name = T2.person    WHERE T2.role = 'Helen Lovejoy';        - `SELECT DISTINCT` is used to ensure that we get unique birth names in case there are multiple entries for the same person.    - The `INNER JOIN` operation links the `Person` and `Credit` tables based on the person’s name.    - The `WHERE` clause filters the results to include only the role 'Helen Lovejoy'.  By following these logical steps, we can effectively query the database to find the birth name of the person who voiced 'Helen Lovejoy'.",,

This information is available in the `Episode` table.    - Perform an INNER JOIN between the `Award` table and the `Episode` table on `episode_id` to retrieve the episode's title.  3. **Join with Credit Table:**    - To analyze the roles (credited vs. uncredited) in the identified episode, we need to use the `Credit` table, which contains information about whether a role was credited or not.    - Perform an INNER JOIN between the `Award` table and the `Credit` table on `episode_id` to get the credit details for the episode.  4. **Calculate the Percentage Ratio:**    - Use a CASE statement to count the number of uncredited roles (`credited = 'false'`) and credited roles (`credited = 'true'`).    - Calculate the percentage ratio of uncredited roles to credited roles using the formula: `(number of uncredited roles / number of credited roles) * 100`.  5. **Retrieve Uncredited Persons and Their Roles:**    - While calculating the ratio, also select the names of persons and their roles where `credited = 'false'` to list them alongside the calculated percentage.  6. **Formulate the SQL Query:**    - Combine all the above steps into a single SQL query using appropriate JOINs, WHERE clauses, and SELECT statements to retrieve the required information.  7. **Execute and Verify:**    - Execute the SQL query to ensure it returns the correct percentage ratio, episode title, and list of uncredited persons with their roles.  By following these steps, we can construct a SQL query that provides the desired output for the given problem.",,

This requires us to focus on the `votes` column in the `Episode` table.  2. **Identify the Relevant Table and Column**: From the schema provided, identify that the `Episode` table contains information about each episode, including the number of votes each episode has received. The relevant column for this problem is `votes`.  3. **Determine the Condition for Filtering**: We need to filter episodes where the `votes` column has a value greater than 1000. This condition will help us isolate the episodes that meet the criteria specified in the problem statement.  4. **Select the Appropriate SQL Function**: Since the problem asks for the number of episodes, we need to count the episodes that satisfy the condition. The SQL `COUNT()` function is suitable for this purpose as it will count the number of rows that meet the specified condition.  5. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Start with the `SELECT` statement to specify what we want to retrieve, which is the count of episodes.    - Use the `COUNT()` function to count the `episode_id` values that meet the condition.    - Use the `FROM` clause to specify the `Episode` table as the source of data.    - Apply the `WHERE` clause to filter the episodes where the `votes` column is greater than 1000.  6. **Write the SQL Query**: Combining all the above steps, the SQL query becomes:        SELECT COUNT(episode_id) FROM Episode WHERE votes > 1000;      7. **Verify the Query**: Ensure that the query correctly counts the number of episodes with more than 1000 votes by reviewing the logic and structure of the query. The query should accurately reflect the problem statement and the schema provided.  By following these steps, we can logically arrive at the solution to the problem using SQL.",,

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logical reasoning process to arrive at the solution:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to find awards and their categories that were nominated by Marc Wilmore.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - The problem involves awards and a specific person (Marc Wilmore).     - The `Award` table contains information about awards, including the `award_id`, `award_category`, `award`, and `person` columns.    - The `Person` table might seem relevant initially, but since the `Award` table already includes the `person` column, we can directly use the `Award` table.  3. **Determine the Filtering Condition**:    - We need to filter the awards where the `person` column matches ""Marc Wilmore"". This is a straightforward condition that can be applied directly in the SQL query.  4. **Select the Required Columns**:    - The problem asks for the ""name of all awards"" and the ""award category"".     - In the `Award` table, the `award` column represents the name of the award, and the `award_category` column represents the category of the award.  5. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Based on the above analysis, we need to select the `award` and `award_category` columns from the `Award` table where the `person` is ""Marc Wilmore"".  6. **Write the SQL Query**:    - The SQL query can be written as:            SELECT award, award_category FROM Award WHERE person = 'Marc Wilmore';        7. **Verify the Solution**:    - Ensure that the query correctly retrieves the desired information by checking against the schema and understanding the relationships between the tables.

Here is a breakdown of the reasoning process:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - The task is to find the average height for each person. This implies that we need to calculate the average of the height values present in the dataset.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - Review the schema to determine which table contains information about people and their heights. In this case, the `Person` table is relevant because it includes a column named `height_meters`.  3. **Check Data Availability**:    - Ensure that the `height_meters` column in the `Person` table contains data. From the samples provided, it appears that this column may contain `NULL` values, indicating missing data.  4. **Determine the SQL Functionality Needed**:    - To calculate an average, we need to use the SQL `AVG()` function, which computes the average of a set of values. This function automatically handles `NULL` values by ignoring them in the calculation.  5. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Since the problem asks for the average height for each person, and given that we are dealing with a single table and column, we can directly apply the `AVG()` function to the `height_meters` column in the `Person` table.  6. **Write the SQL Query**:    - The query should select the average height from the `Person` table. The SQL query is:            SELECT AVG(height_meters) FROM Person;        7. **Consider Edge Cases**:    - Consider what happens if all values are `NULL`. The `AVG()` function will return `NULL` in such a case, which is acceptable since it indicates there is no data to compute an average.  8. **Execute and Validate**:    - Execute the query in a SQL environment to ensure it returns the expected result. Validate the output by checking if it makes sense given the data available.  By following these steps, we logically arrive at the solution to find the average height for each person using the available data in the `Person` table.",,

This implies that we are interested in the maximum and minimum values of votes for episodes.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - From the schema provided, the `Vote` table contains a `votes` column, which records the number of votes for each episode. This is the relevant column for our calculation.  3. **Clarify the Scope**:    - Ensure that the calculation is intended for all episodes collectively, rather than for each episode individually. The problem statement does not specify grouping by episode, so we assume it is a collective calculation.  4. **Determine the SQL Functions Needed**:    - To find the highest and lowest votes, we need to use aggregate functions: `MAX()` to find the maximum votes and `MIN()` to find the minimum votes.  5. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Use a single SQL query to calculate the difference between the maximum and minimum votes. The SQL query will look like this:            SELECT MAX(votes) - MIN(votes) FROM Vote;          - This query calculates the maximum votes and minimum votes across all records in the `Vote` table and then computes their difference.  6. **Verify the Solution**:    - Ensure that the query correctly captures the requirement by checking if it returns a single numerical value representing the difference between the highest and lowest votes.  7. **Consider Edge Cases**:    - Consider scenarios such as if the `Vote` table is empty or contains only one entry. The SQL functions should handle these cases gracefully, returning `NULL` or `0` as appropriate.  By following these steps, we can logically derive the solution to the problem using the given schema and requirements.",,

This requires accessing information about awards and episodes.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**: From the schema, identify which tables contain the necessary information:    - The `Award` table contains details about awards, including the year, category, and result.    - The `Episode` table contains details about episodes, including the title and episode ID.  3. **Determine the Necessary Columns**:    - From the `Award` table, we need the columns: `year`, `award`, `result`, and `episode_id`.    - From the `Episode` table, we need the columns: `episode_id` and `title`.  4. **Establish a Relationship Between Tables**:     - The common column between the `Award` and `Episode` tables is `episode_id`. This will allow us to join these tables.  5. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Use an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Award` and `Episode` tables based on the `episode_id`.    - Filter the results to only include rows where the `year` is 2017, the `award` is ""Best International TV Series,"" and the `result` is ""Winner"".  6. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Start by selecting the `title` from the `Episode` table.    - Join the `Award` table to the `Episode` table using `episode_id`.    - Apply the `WHERE` clause to filter for the specific year, award, and result.  7. **Execute and Validate**:    - Execute the query to retrieve the desired episode title.    - Validate that the result matches the criteria specified in the problem.  By following these steps, we can construct the SQL query:   SELECT T2.title  FROM Award AS T1  INNER JOIN Episode AS T2  ON T1.episode_id = T2.episode_id  WHERE SUBSTR(T1.year, 1, 4) = '2017'  AND T1.award = 'Best International TV Series'  AND T1.result = 'Winner';   This query will return the title of the episode that won the Best International TV Series Award in 2017.",,

This will allow us to link it with the credits.  4. **Filter Credits for the Episode**:    - Use the `Credit` table to find entries where the `episode_id` matches the one found in the previous step.    - Focus on entries where the `credited` column is marked as 'false', indicating persons who were not credited.  5. **Join Tables**:    - Perform an INNER JOIN between the `Episode` and `Credit` tables on the `episode_id` to associate episodes with their credits.    - Filter the results to only include the episode titled 'How the Test Was Won' and where `credited` is 'false'.  6. **Select the Required Data**:    - Select the `person` column from the joined tables to get the names of people who were not credited for the episode.  7. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Construct the SQL query using the above logic to retrieve the desired results.

To ensure both keywords are present, a subquery or a GROUP BY with a HAVING clause might be necessary.  7. **Refine the Query for Both Keywords**:    - Use a subquery to ensure that an episode has both keywords. This can be done by counting the distinct keywords for each episode and ensuring both 'riot' and 'cake' are present.  8. **Final SQL Query**:        SELECT T1.title     FROM Episode AS T1     WHERE T1.episode_id IN (        SELECT T2.episode_id         FROM Keyword AS T2         WHERE T2.keyword IN ('riot', 'cake')        GROUP BY T2.episode_id        HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT T2.keyword) = 2    );      By following these steps, you ensure that the query accurately retrieves the title of the episode that contains both specified keywords.",,

The `Episode` table contains information about episodes, including their titles and total votes. The `Vote` table contains detailed voting information, including the number of votes for each star rating per episode.  3. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - **`Episode` Table**: Contains `episode_id`, `title`, and `votes` columns, which are necessary to identify episodes and their total votes.    - **`Vote` Table**: Contains `episode_id`, `stars`, and `votes` columns, which are necessary to filter votes specifically for the 10-star rating.  4. **Determine the Join Condition**: Since we need to relate information from both the `Episode` and `Vote` tables, identify the common column for joining, which is `episode_id`.  5. **Filter for 10-Star Ratings**: In the `Vote` table, filter the records where the `stars` column equals 10, as we are only interested in votes for a 10-star rating.  6. **Aggregate Votes for 10-Star Ratings**: Sum the `votes` from the `Vote` table for each episode where `stars` equals 10. This will give us the total number of 10-star votes each episode received.  7. **Join Tables**: Perform an INNER JOIN between the `Episode` and `Vote` tables on the `episode_id` to combine episode details with their respective 10-star votes.  8. **Order and Limit Results**: Order the results by the number of 10-star votes in descending order to identify the episode with the highest number of such votes. Use `LIMIT 1` to get only the top result.  9. **Select the Desired Output**: Finally, select the `title` of the episode from the `Episode` table that has the most 10-star votes.  By following these steps, we can construct the SQL query that efficiently retrieves the desired information. The solution query is:   SELECT T1.title  FROM Episode AS T1  INNER JOIN Vote AS T2 ON T2.episode_id = T1.episode_id  WHERE T2.stars = 10  ORDER BY T1.votes DESC  LIMIT 1;   This query correctly identifies the episode with the most votes for a 10-star rating by leveraging the relationships and data within the provided schema.",,

This can be done by examining the `air_date` column and extracting the month part of the date.  4. **Extract the Month from the Air Date**:    - Use a string function to extract the month from the `air_date` column. The `SUBSTR` function can be used to get the month part (characters 6 and 7 in the date string).  5. **Filter by Month**:    - Ensure that the extracted month is either '10' (October) or '11' (November). This can be done using a condition in the WHERE clause.  6. **Join Tables to Get Person Information**:    - Perform an INNER JOIN between the `Episode` table and the `Credit` table on the `episode_id` column. This will allow us to link episodes with the people credited in their production.  7. **Select Distinct People**:    - Use the `DISTINCT` keyword to ensure that each person is listed only once, even if they were involved in multiple episodes.  8. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Combine all these steps into a single SQL query:            SELECT DISTINCT T2.person       FROM Episode AS T1       INNER JOIN Credit AS T2 ON T1.episode_id = T2.episode_id       WHERE SUBSTR(T1.air_date, 6, 2) BETWEEN '10' AND '11';        By following these logical steps, we ensure that the query accurately retrieves the names of all individuals involved in the production of the specified episodes.",,

Here are the logical steps to reach the solution:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to find out how many distinct roles were played in the 5th episode of season 20 of ""The Simpsons.""    - The relevant information is likely stored in the `Episode` and `Credit` tables.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - The `Episode` table contains information about each episode, including the `episode_id`, `season`, and `episode` number.    - The `Credit` table contains information about the roles played in each episode, with columns such as `episode_id` and `role`.  3. **Determine the Episode of Interest**:    - We are interested in the 5th episode of season 20. From the `Episode` table, we can filter rows where `season` is 20 and `episode` is 5.    - Alternatively, since the problem specifies the 5th episode, we can directly filter using `episode = 5`.  4. **Join the Tables**:    - To find the roles associated with the 5th episode, we need to join the `Episode` table with the `Credit` table.    - The common column to join these tables is `episode_id`.  5. **Filter the Desired Episode**:    - Use a `WHERE` clause to filter the results to only include the 5th episode. This can be done by specifying `T1.episode = 5` in the `WHERE` clause.  6. **Count Distinct Roles**:    - After joining and filtering, we need to count the distinct roles from the `Credit` table for the specified episode.    - Use `COUNT(DISTINCT T2.role)` to count the number of unique roles.  7. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Combine all the steps into a single SQL query:            SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT T2.role)      FROM Episode AS T1      INNER JOIN Credit AS T2 ON T1.episode_id = T2.episode_id      WHERE T1.episode = 5;        8. **Verify the Solution**:    - Ensure that the query correctly counts the distinct roles for the specified episode by reviewing the logic and the schema.

This relationship allows us to connect episode details with their respective keywords.  4. **Formulate the Query Structure:**    - We need to perform an `INNER JOIN` between the `Episode` and `Keyword` tables to get keywords for a specific episode.    - The `INNER JOIN` will be based on the `episode_id` column, ensuring that we only get keywords for episodes that exist in both tables.  5. **Filter for the Specific Episode:**    - We need to filter the results to only include the episode titled ""Take My Life, Please.""

By following these steps, we can construct the SQL query that calculates the desired ratio:   SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN T1.title = 'No Loan Again, Naturally' THEN T2.votes ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) /         SUM(CASE WHEN T1.title = 'Coming to Homerica' THEN T2.votes ELSE 0 END) AS ratio FROM Episode AS T1 INNER JOIN Vote AS T2 ON T2.episode_id = T1.episode_id WHERE T2.stars = 5;   This query joins the `Episode` and `Vote` tables, filters for 5-star votes, and calculates the ratio of votes for the specified episodes.",,

This means we are interested in entries where he was nominated, not necessarily where he won.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:     - The `Award` table is relevant because it contains information about awards, including the organization, the person nominated, and the result (whether they were a nominee or winner).    - The columns of interest in the `Award` table are `person`, `organization`, and `result`.  3. **Formulate the Query**:    - We need to filter the `Award` table for entries where the `person` is Ian Maxtone-Graham.    - We also need to ensure the `organization` is 'Writers Guild of America, USA'.    - Additionally, we are only interested in entries where the `result` is 'Nominee', as the problem specifies nominations.  4. **Count the Relevant Entries**:    - After filtering the entries based on the above criteria, we need to count the number of such entries. This will give us the number of times Ian Maxtone-Graham was nominated.  5. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Using the SQL `SELECT` statement, we can count the number of entries that match our criteria. The query would look like this:            SELECT COUNT(award_id)       FROM Award       WHERE person = 'Ian Maxtone-Graham'         AND organization = 'Writers Guild of America, USA'         AND result = 'Nominee';        6. **Verify the Query**:    - Ensure that the query correctly reflects the problem statement and that all conditions are included to filter the data accurately.  By following these steps, we can effectively determine the number of nominations Ian Maxtone-Graham received from the Writers Guild of America, USA.",,
