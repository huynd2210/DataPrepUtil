Here's how we can approach the problem:  1. **Understand the Schema and Problem**:     - We have multiple tables: `employee`, `establishment`, `inspection`, `inspection_point`, and `violation`.    - The problem asks for the number of inspections in 2010 that had serious food safety issues.     - Serious food safety issues are likely indicated by a high `risk_level` in the `establishment` table.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - The `inspection` table contains information about each inspection, including `inspection_date` and `license_no`.    - The `establishment` table contains `risk_level`, which can indicate the seriousness of food safety issues.    - We need to join `inspection` and `establishment` tables using the `license_no` to link inspections to establishments.  3. **Filter Inspections by Date**:    - We need to focus on inspections conducted in the year 2010. This can be done by filtering the `inspection_date` column in the `inspection` table.  4. **Determine Serious Food Safety Issues**:    - Assume that a `risk_level` of 3 in the `establishment` table indicates a serious food safety issue.    - Filter the joined data for establishments with `risk_level = 3`.  5. **Count the Relevant Inspections**:    - After filtering the inspections that occurred in 2010 and are associated with establishments having a `risk_level` of 3, count the number of such inspections.  6. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Join the `establishment` and `inspection` tables on `license_no`.    - Filter the results where the year of `inspection_date` is 2010 and `risk_level` is 3.    - Use the `COUNT` function to get the total number of inspections that meet these criteria.  7. **Construct the SQL Query**:        SELECT COUNT(T2.inspection_id)    FROM establishment AS T1    INNER JOIN inspection AS T2 ON T1.license_no = T2.license_no    WHERE strftime('%Y', T2.inspection_date) = '2010' AND T1.risk_level = 3;      8. **Verify the Query**:    - Ensure that the query correctly counts only those inspections that match the criteria.    - Test the query against the database to ensure it returns the expected results.  By following these logical steps, we can systematically approach the problem and construct a query that accurately answers the question.",,

Here's how we can approach the problem:  1. **Understand the Schema and Problem Statement:**    - We have three main tables: `employee`, `establishment`, and `inspection`.    - The task is to find the names of DBAs (Doing Business As) with verified quality. ""Verified quality"" in this context likely means establishments that have passed inspections.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns:**    - The `establishment` table contains the `dba_name`, which is the name of the business we are interested in.    - The `inspection` table contains the `results` column, which indicates the outcome of inspections. We are interested in rows where the result is ""Pass"".    - The `inspection` table also has a `license_no` column that can be used to link it to the `establishment` table.  3. **Determine the Relationship Between Tables:**    - The `establishment` table and the `inspection` table can be joined using the `license_no` column, as both tables contain this column.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query:**    - We need to select distinct `dba_name` values from the `establishment` table where the corresponding inspection results are ""Pass"".    - Use an INNER JOIN to combine the `establishment` and `inspection` tables on the `license_no` column.    - Filter the results to include only those rows where the `results` column in the `inspection` table contains ""Pass"".  5. **Write the SQL Query:**    - The SQL query can be written as follows:            SELECT DISTINCT T1.dba_name      FROM establishment AS T1      INNER JOIN inspection AS T2 ON T1.license_no = T2.license_no      WHERE T2.results LIKE '%Pass%'          - This query selects distinct DBA names from the `establishment` table where there is a corresponding inspection result of ""Pass"", ensuring we only get businesses with verified quality.  6. **Verify the Solution:**    - Ensure that the query correctly identifies all DBAs with at least one passing inspection.    - Check that the use of `DISTINCT` is appropriate to avoid duplicate DBA names in the result set.  By following these logical steps, we ensure that the solution is both accurate and efficient, addressing the problem statement effectively.",,

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the logical reasoning process to arrive at the solution:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to find the total salary of employees who performed inspections with specific IDs (52270 to 52272).    - This requires us to identify which employees conducted these inspections and then sum their salaries.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - We have two main tables of interest: `inspection` and `employee`.    - The `inspection` table contains `inspection_id` and `employee_id`, which will help us identify which employees conducted the inspections.    - The `employee` table contains `employee_id` and `salary`, which will allow us to retrieve the salary information for each employee.  3. **Determine the Relationship Between Tables**:    - The `inspection` table and the `employee` table are related through the `employee_id` column. This relationship allows us to join these tables to get the necessary information.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - We need to join the `inspection` table with the `employee` table on the `employee_id` column to access both inspection and salary information.    - Use an `INNER JOIN` to ensure we only get records where there is a matching `employee_id` in both tables.  5. **Filter the Inspections by ID Range**:    - Use a `WHERE` clause to filter the inspections to only those with `inspection_id` between 52270 and 52272.  6. **Calculate the Total Salary**:    - Use the `SUM` function to calculate the total salary of the employees who conducted the filtered inspections.  7. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Combine all the above steps into a single SQL query:            SELECT SUM(T2.salary)      FROM inspection AS T1      INNER JOIN employee AS T2 ON T1.employee_id = T2.employee_id      WHERE T1.inspection_id BETWEEN 52270 AND 52272;        8. **Review and Validate the Query**:    - Ensure the query logic aligns with the problem requirements.    - Check that the query correctly joins the tables, filters the inspections, and calculates the total salary.  By following these steps, we can systematically solve the problem and arrive at the correct SQL query.",,

This involves identifying the restaurant in the database and filtering inspection records by date.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**: From the schema provided, the relevant tables are:    - `establishment`: This table contains information about restaurants, including their names and license numbers.    - `inspection`: This table contains inspection records, including inspection dates and license numbers.  3. **Determine Key Columns**:    - From the `establishment` table, we need the `dba_name` column to identify the restaurant ""John Schaller"".    - From the `inspection` table, we need the `inspection_date` column to find the date of inspections and the `license_no` column to link inspections to establishments.  4. **Establish Table Relationships**: The `license_no` column is common to both the `establishment` and `inspection` tables, allowing us to join these tables and associate inspections with specific restaurants.  5. **Filter by Restaurant Name**: Use the `dba_name` column in the `establishment` table to filter for the restaurant ""John Schaller"".  6. **Filter by Year**: Use the `inspection_date` column in the `inspection` table to filter for inspections that occurred in the year 2010. This can be done by extracting the year from the date.  7. **Find the Earliest Date**: Once the relevant inspections are filtered, use an aggregate function to find the minimum inspection date, which represents the first inspection in 2010.  8. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Join the `establishment` and `inspection` tables on `license_no`.    - Apply the filters for `dba_name` and the year 2010.    - Use `MIN()` to find the earliest inspection date.  The final SQL query is:  SELECT MIN(T2.inspection_date) FROM establishment AS T1 INNER JOIN inspection AS T2 ON T1.license_no = T2.license_no WHERE T1.dba_name = 'JOHN SCHALLER' AND strftime('%Y', T2.inspection_date) = '2010'   This query effectively retrieves the earliest inspection date for ""John Schaller"" in 2010 by leveraging table joins, filtering, and aggregation.",,

Therefore, we need to filter the `employee` table to find the `employee_id` for Joshua Rosa. This is done by selecting records where `first_name` is 'Joshua' and `last_name` is 'Rosa'.  3. **Link Inspections to the Employee**:    - Once we have identified Joshua Rosa's `employee_id`, we can use it to find all related inspections in the `inspection` table. This involves joining the `employee` table with the `inspection` table on the `employee_id` column.  4. **Link Inspections to Establishments**:    - Each inspection is associated with an establishment via the `license_no`. We need to join the `inspection` table with the `establishment` table using the `license_no` column to retrieve establishment details.  5. **Select the Desired Information**:    - Our goal is to list the establishments inspected by Joshua Rosa. We are interested in the `dba_name` (doing business as name) from the `establishment` table.  6. **Ensure Uniqueness**:    - Since an establishment might be inspected multiple times, we use `DISTINCT` to ensure each establishment is listed only once in the result.  7. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Combine all the above steps into a single SQL query:            SELECT DISTINCT T3.dba_name      FROM employee AS T1      INNER JOIN inspection AS T2 ON T1.employee_id = T2.employee_id      INNER JOIN establishment AS T3 ON T2.license_no = T3.license_no      WHERE T1.first_name = 'Joshua' AND T1.last_name = 'Rosa';          - This query joins the necessary tables, filters for Joshua Rosa, and selects distinct establishment names.

Here are the logical steps to reach the solution:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: We need to find the number of employees who earn more than 70,000 and have failed an inspection. This requires us to work with the `employee` and `inspection` tables.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - The `employee` table contains information about employees, including their `employee_id` and `salary`.    - The `inspection` table contains inspection results, including `employee_id` and `results`.  3. **Determine the Join Condition**:    - We need to connect the `employee` table with the `inspection` table using the `employee_id` column, as it is the common attribute between the two tables.  4. **Filter Conditions**:    - From the `employee` table, filter employees with a `salary` greater than 70,000.    - From the `inspection` table, filter records where the `results` column indicates a ""Fail"".  5. **Combine Conditions**:    - Use an INNER JOIN to combine the filtered results from both tables based on the `employee_id`.    - Ensure that both conditions (salary > 70,000 and inspection result = 'Fail') are satisfied simultaneously for each employee.  6. **Count Distinct Employees**:    - Use the `COUNT(DISTINCT T1.employee_id)` function to count the number of unique employees who meet both conditions. This ensures that each employee is counted only once, even if they have multiple failed inspections.  7. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Construct the SQL query to implement the above logic:            SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT T1.employee_id)      FROM employee AS T1      INNER JOIN inspection AS T2 ON T1.employee_id = T2.employee_id      WHERE T2.results = 'Fail' AND T1.salary > 70000;        8. **Verify the Solution**:    - Review the query to ensure it accurately reflects the problem requirements and correctly uses SQL syntax to achieve the desired result.  By following these steps, we logically derive the solution to count the number of employees who earn more than 70,000 and have failed an inspection.",,

The key elements here are the business names, the inspection results, and the inspection year.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - **establishment**: This table contains information about the businesses, including `dba_name` (doing business as name) and `license_no`.    - **inspection**: This table contains inspection details, including `inspection_date`, `results`, and `license_no`.  3. **Determine the Relationship Between Tables**:    - The `establishment` and `inspection` tables are related through the `license_no` column, which is common to both tables. This relationship allows us to join these tables to get the required information.  4. **Filter Inspections by Year**:    - We need to extract inspections from the year 2010. The `inspection_date` column in the `inspection` table can be used for this purpose. We can use a function like `strftime` to extract the year from the date and filter it to 2010.  5. **Filter Inspections by Result**:    - We are only interested in inspections that resulted in a ""Pass"". Therefore, we need to filter the `results` column in the `inspection` table to include only rows where the result is ""Pass"".  6. **Join Tables**:    - Perform an INNER JOIN between the `establishment` and `inspection` tables on the `license_no` column to combine the business information with the inspection results.  7. **Select Distinct Business Names**:    - Since a business might have multiple inspections in 2010, we should use `SELECT DISTINCT` to ensure that each business name appears only once in the result set.  8. **Consider Additional Filters (if any)**:    - The solution provided includes a filter for `facility_type` being 'Liquor'. This suggests that the problem might have additional constraints not explicitly mentioned. If this is the case, we should include this filter in the query.  9. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Based on the above steps, construct the SQL query to retrieve the desired information.  Here is the constructed SQL query based on these steps:   SELECT DISTINCT T1.dba_name  FROM establishment AS T1  INNER JOIN inspection AS T2 ON T1.license_no = T2.license_no  WHERE strftime('%Y', T2.inspection_date) = '2010'  AND T2.results = 'Pass'  AND T1.facility_type = 'Liquor';   This query retrieves distinct business names from the `establishment` table where the business passed an inspection in 2010 and is of the facility type 'Liquor'.",,

Here’s how you can approach the problem:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: We need to find out how many taverns (restaurants) failed inspections in July 2010. The keyword here is ""failed,"" which suggests we need to look at inspection results.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - **establishment**: This table contains information about different establishments, including their type (facility_type) and license number (license_no).    - **inspection**: This table contains inspection details, including the date (inspection_date), result (results), and the license number (license_no) that links it to the establishment.  3. **Determine the Necessary Conditions**:    - We are interested in establishments of type ""Restaurant"" (since ""tavern"" is not explicitly mentioned in the schema, ""Restaurant"" is the closest match).    - We need inspections that resulted in a ""Fail.""    - The inspections must have occurred in July 2010.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - **Join the Tables**: Since we need information from both the establishment and inspection tables, we will perform an INNER JOIN on the license_no column, which is common to both tables.    - **Filter by Date**: Use the `strftime` function to extract the year and month from the inspection_date column and filter for '2010-07'.    - **Filter by Result**: Ensure that the results column in the inspection table is 'Fail'.    - **Filter by Facility Type**: Ensure that the facility_type in the establishment table is 'Restaurant'.    - **Count Distinct Licenses**: Since we want to know how many unique taverns failed, we count the distinct license numbers that meet all the criteria.  5. **Write the SQL Query**:    - The final query is:            SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT T1.license_no)      FROM establishment AS T1      INNER JOIN inspection AS T2 ON T1.license_no = T2.license_no      WHERE strftime('%Y-%m', T2.inspection_date) = '2010-07'      AND T2.results = 'Fail'      AND T1.facility_type = 'Restaurant';        6. **Verify the Solution**:    - Double-check that all conditions are correctly implemented in the query.    - Ensure that the join is correctly linking the tables through the license_no column.    - Confirm that the date filtering is accurately capturing only July 2010.  By following these logical steps, you can systematically arrive at the solution to the problem.",,

Here’s how you can approach the problem:  1. **Understand the Schema and Relationships**:    - We have three relevant tables: `employee`, `inspection`, and `establishment`.    - The `employee` table contains information about employees, including their names and IDs.    - The `inspection` table links employees to inspections via `employee_id` and to establishments via `license_no`.    - The `establishment` table contains details about establishments, including their risk levels and license numbers.  2. **Identify the Information Needed**:    - We need to find the risk level of the establishment that Bob Benson inspected.    - This requires us to connect Bob Benson (an employee) to the inspections he conducted and then to the establishments he inspected.  3. **Locate Bob Benson in the Employee Table**:    - Use the `employee` table to find Bob Benson's `employee_id` by filtering on `first_name` and `last_name`.  4. **Find Inspections Conducted by Bob Benson**:    - Use the `inspection` table to find all inspections where `employee_id` matches Bob Benson's `employee_id`.    - This will give us the `license_no` of the establishments he inspected.  5. **Determine the Risk Level of the Inspected Establishments**:    - Use the `establishment` table to find the risk level by matching the `license_no` from the `inspection` table.    - This will give us the risk level of the establishments inspected by Bob Benson.  6. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Start by writing a query that joins the `employee` table with the `inspection` table on `employee_id`.    - Then, join the result with the `establishment` table on `license_no`.    - Filter the results to only include records where the employee's first name is 'Bob' and the last name is 'Benson'.    - Select the distinct risk level from the results.  7. **Execute and Verify the Query**:    - Execute the SQL query to ensure it returns the correct risk level.    - Verify the results to ensure they match the expected output based on the given data.  By following these steps, you can logically derive the SQL solution to find the risk level of the establishment that Bob Benson inspected.",,

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logical reasoning process to arrive at the solution:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement:**    - We need to find the title of an employee who inspected an establishment with the license number 1576687.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables:**    - From the schema, identify which tables contain the necessary information:      - `employee`: Contains employee details including their title.      - `inspection`: Contains inspection details including the employee ID and the license number of the establishment inspected.  3. **Determine the Relationship Between Tables:**    - The `inspection` table links employees to establishments through the `employee_id` and `license_no` columns.    - The `employee` table contains the `employee_id` and `title` columns.  4. **Plan the SQL Query:**    - We need to join the `employee` and `inspection` tables to access both the employee's title and the license number of the establishment they inspected.  5. **Construct the SQL Query:**    - Use an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `employee` and `inspection` tables based on the `employee_id` column, which is common to both tables.    - Filter the results to only include rows where the `license_no` is 1576687.    - Select the `title` from the `employee` table.  6. **Ensure Unique Results:**    - Since we are only interested in the title and there might be multiple inspections by the same employee, use `DISTINCT` to ensure the result is unique.  7. **Write the SQL Query:**    - The final SQL query is:            SELECT DISTINCT T1.title      FROM employee AS T1      INNER JOIN inspection AS T2 ON T1.employee_id = T2.employee_id      WHERE T2.license_no = 1576687;        8. **Verify the Query:**    - Double-check that the query correctly joins the tables and filters the results based on the specified license number.  By following these logical steps, we can systematically arrive at the correct SQL solution to the problem.",,

Here are the logical steps to reach the solution:  1. **Understand the Schema and Problem Requirements**:     - We have multiple tables, but the relevant ones for this problem are `establishment` and `inspection`.    - The `establishment` table contains information about each establishment, including its `risk_level`.    - The `inspection` table contains inspection results for each establishment, identified by `license_no`.    - We need to calculate the percentage of establishments with a `risk_level` of 1 among those that have passed the inspection.  2. **Identify Relevant Data**:    - Focus on the `establishment` table for `risk_level` and `license_no`.    - Focus on the `inspection` table for `results` and `license_no`.  3. **Determine the Necessary Join**:    - Since we need to relate the risk level of establishments to their inspection results, we need to join the `establishment` and `inspection` tables on `license_no`.  4. **Filter the Data**:    - We are only interested in establishments that have passed the inspection. Therefore, filter the joined data where `inspection.results = 'Pass'`.  5. **Calculate the Required Counts**:    - Count the total number of establishments that passed the inspection.    - Count the number of establishments that passed the inspection and have a `risk_level` of 1.  6. **Calculate the Percentage**:    - Use the formula: (Number of establishments with risk level 1 and passed inspection / Total number of establishments that passed inspection) * 100 to get the percentage.  7. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Use a `CASE` statement within the `COUNT` function to count only those establishments with `risk_level = 1`.    - Use `CAST` to ensure the division results in a real number for percentage calculation.    - The SQL query is structured as follows:   SELECT CAST(COUNT(CASE WHEN T1.risk_level = 1 THEN T1.license_no END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(T1.license_no) FROM establishment AS T1 INNER JOIN inspection AS T2 ON T1.license_no = T2.license_no WHERE T2.results = 'Pass';   8. **Verify and Test the Query**:    - Ensure the query logic aligns with the problem requirements.    - Test the query with sample data to verify the correctness of the results.

In this case, it is the `employee` table.    - Determine which columns in the `employee` table are relevant for solving the problem:      - `first_name` and `last_name` to identify the employee.      - `address`, `city`, and `state` to retrieve the location information.  3. **Formulate the Query:**    - Construct a SQL query that selects the necessary columns (`address`, `city`, `state`) from the `employee` table.    - Use a `WHERE` clause to filter the records based on the employee's name. Specifically, match the `first_name` with ""Standard"" and the `last_name` with ""Murray"".  4. **Write the SQL Query:**    - Combine the identified columns and conditions into a complete SQL statement:            SELECT address, city, state FROM employee WHERE first_name = 'Standard' AND last_name = 'Murray';        5. **Verify the Query:**    - Ensure that the query logically retrieves the correct information by checking that all conditions and selected columns align with the problem requirements.    - Consider edge cases, such as ensuring there are no typos in the name and that the columns selected are indeed the ones needed to answer the problem.

Here’s a breakdown of the thought process:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement:**    - The task is to find out the salary of an employee named Jessica Anthony.  2. **Review the Schema:**    - We have a schema with several tables, but the relevant table for employee details is the `employee` table.    - The `employee` table contains columns such as `first_name`, `last_name`, and `salary`, which are pertinent to solving this problem.  3. **Identify Relevant Columns:**    - From the problem statement, we need to focus on the `first_name`, `last_name`, and `salary` columns in the `employee` table.    - `first_name` and `last_name` will be used to identify the correct employee, and `salary` will provide the information we need.  4. **Formulate the Query:**    - We need to construct a query that selects the `salary` of the employee whose `first_name` is ""Jessica"" and `last_name` is ""Anthony"".    - This translates to a SQL `SELECT` statement with a `WHERE` clause to filter the records.  5. **Write the SQL Query:**    - The SQL query should look like this:            SELECT salary FROM employee WHERE first_name = 'Jessica' AND last_name = 'Anthony';          - This query selects the `salary` from the `employee` table where the `first_name` is ""Jessica"" and the `last_name` is ""Anthony"".  6. **Validate the Query:**    - Ensure that the query correctly identifies the employee by checking the database for any potential issues such as multiple entries for the same name or case sensitivity.    - Assuming the database is well-structured and names are unique, this query should return the correct salary.  By following these logical steps, we can confidently arrive at the solution to the problem using the provided schema and SQL query.",,

The problem specifies the coordinates: latitude ""41.9532864854"" and longitude ""-87.7673790701422"".  2. **Identify the Relevant Table**: From the given schema, identify which table contains information about restaurants and their locations. The `establishment` table seems relevant because it includes columns like `latitude`, `longitude`, `dba_name` (doing business as name), and `facility_type`.  3. **Determine the Necessary Columns**: We need to retrieve the `dba_name` of the restaurant. To do this, we must filter the table by the given `latitude` and `longitude`.  4. **Filter by Facility Type**: Since we are specifically looking for a restaurant, we should also filter the results by `facility_type` to ensure we only consider establishments that are restaurants.  5. **Formulate the SQL Query**: Based on the above steps, construct an SQL query that selects the `dba_name` from the `establishment` table where the `latitude` and `longitude` match the given coordinates and the `facility_type` is 'Restaurant'.  6. **Write the SQL Query**:         SELECT dba_name     FROM establishment     WHERE latitude = 41.9532864854       AND longitude = -87.7673790701422       AND facility_type = 'Restaurant';      7. **Verify the Solution**: Ensure that the query is correctly structured to retrieve the desired information and that it logically filters the data based on the problem requirements.

This requires us to count the number of employees who are designated as supervisors in the employee table.  2. **Review the Schema**: Examine the schema provided to identify where relevant information is stored. The schema includes several tables, but the focus should be on the `employee` table because it contains employee-related data, including job titles.  3. **Identify Relevant Columns**: In the `employee` table, the `title` column is crucial because it indicates the job title of each employee. We are specifically interested in those with the title ""Supervisor"".  4. **Formulate the Query**:     - Use the `SELECT` statement to retrieve data.    - Use the `COUNT` function to count the number of employees with the title ""Supervisor"".    - Add a `WHERE` clause to filter the employees based on the condition that their title is ""Supervisor"".  5. **Construct the SQL Query**: Based on the above understanding, construct the SQL query:        SELECT COUNT(employee_id) FROM employee WHERE title = 'Supervisor';        - `COUNT(employee_id)`: This function counts the number of rows that meet the specified condition.    - `FROM employee`: This specifies the table from which to retrieve data.    - `WHERE title = 'Supervisor'`: This filters the rows to only include those where the title is ""Supervisor"".  6. **Verify the Logic**: Ensure that the query accurately reflects the problem statement. The query should correctly count all employees with the title ""Supervisor"" without any additional conditions or joins, as the problem is straightforward.  7. **Execute and Validate**: Run the query against the database to get the count of supervisors. Validate the results to ensure they meet expectations based on the data available.  By following these steps, we can systematically approach and solve the problem using SQL.",,

From the schema, the `establishment` table contains information about establishments, including a `risk_level` column.  3. **Identify the Highest Risk Level:**    - Review the sample data provided in the `risk_level` column of the `establishment` table. The values are 2, 1, 1, 1, and 3. The highest risk level among these is 3.  4. **Formulate the Query:**    - We need to count the number of establishments where the `risk_level` is equal to the highest value identified, which is 3.  5. **Construct the SQL Query:**    - Use the `COUNT` function to count the number of rows where the `risk_level` is 3.    - The SQL query would be: `SELECT COUNT(license_no) FROM establishment WHERE risk_level = 3`.  6. **Verify the Query:**    - Ensure that the query correctly counts the number of establishments with a risk level of 3 by checking against the sample data or running the query on the actual database.

This relationship allows us to link inspections to the employees who conducted them.  4. **Formulate the Query**:    - **Select the Required Data**: We need to retrieve the `last_name` from the `employee` table.    - **Join the Tables**: Use an INNER JOIN to combine the `employee` and `inspection` tables based on the `employee_id` column, which is common to both tables.    - **Filter the Results**: Use a WHERE clause to filter the results to only include the inspection with ID 52256.  5. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Start with a SELECT statement to specify the column to retrieve: `SELECT DISTINCT T1.last_name`.    - Use an INNER JOIN to connect the `employee` table (aliased as T1) with the `inspection` table (aliased as T2) on the `employee_id` column: `FROM employee AS T1 INNER JOIN inspection AS T2 ON T1.employee_id = T2.employee_id`.    - Add a WHERE clause to filter for the specific inspection ID: `WHERE T2.inspection_id = 52256`.  6. **Consider Edge Cases**:    - Use DISTINCT to ensure that if multiple records are returned due to data anomalies, only unique last names are displayed.  7. **Review and Execute**: Double-check the query for accuracy and execute it to retrieve the desired result.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the logical reasoning that could lead to the solution:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement:**    - We need to find the facility type and license number of establishments that have the lowest risk level and failed the inspection.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns:**    - From the schema, the `establishment` table contains information about the facility type, license number, and risk level.    - The `inspection` table contains information about the inspection results and is linked to the `establishment` table via the `license_no` column.  3. **Determine the Conditions for Filtering Data:**    - We need establishments with the lowest risk level. From the `establishment` table, identify that the `risk_level` column is used for this purpose. The lowest risk level is typically represented by the smallest number, which is `1`.    - We need establishments that failed the inspection. From the `inspection` table, identify that the `results` column is used for this purpose, and the value should be `'Fail'`.  4. **Plan the SQL Query:**    - We need to join the `establishment` and `inspection` tables on the `license_no` column to combine relevant information from both tables.    - After joining, filter the results to include only those rows where the `risk_level` is `1` and the `results` is `'Fail'`.  5. **Select the Required Columns:**    - From the combined result set, select the `facility_type` and `license_no` columns as specified in the problem statement.  6. **Ensure Uniqueness:**    - Use `DISTINCT` to ensure that the results do not contain duplicate entries for the same facility type and license number.  7. **Write the SQL Query:**    - Based on the above steps, the SQL query is constructed as follows:            SELECT DISTINCT T1.facility_type, T1.license_no      FROM establishment AS T1      INNER JOIN inspection AS T2 ON T1.license_no = T2.license_no      WHERE T1.risk_level = 1 AND T2.results = 'Fail'        8. **Verify the Query:**    - Ensure that the query correctly captures the requirements by checking the logic and syntax. The `INNER JOIN` ensures that only matching records from both tables are considered, and the `WHERE` clause filters these records based on the specified conditions.  By following these logical steps, we can systematically arrive at the solution for the given SQL problem.",,

Here are the logical steps to arrive at the solution:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to find the inspection result for a specific date (February 24, 2010) and a specific employee (Arnold Holder).  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - We have the `employee` table, which contains employee details including `employee_id`, `first_name`, and `last_name`.    - We have the `inspection` table, which contains inspection details including `inspection_date`, `results`, and `employee_id`.  3. **Determine the Relationship Between Tables**:    - The `inspection` table has a foreign key `employee_id` that links to the `employee_id` in the `employee` table. This relationship allows us to associate inspections with the employees who conducted them.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - We need to join the `employee` and `inspection` tables on the `employee_id` to filter inspections conducted by ""Arnold Holder.""    - Use an `INNER JOIN` to combine records from both tables where the `employee_id` matches.  5. **Apply the Necessary Filters**:    - Filter the records where `first_name` is 'Arnold' and `last_name` is 'Holder' in the `employee` table.    - Filter the records where `inspection_date` is '2010-02-24' in the `inspection` table.  6. **Select the Required Output**:    - We are interested in the `results` of the inspection, so we select this column from the `inspection` table.  7. **Ensure Unique Results**:    - Use `DISTINCT` to ensure that if there are multiple records with the same result, we only return it once.  8. **Write the Final SQL Query**:    - Combine all the above steps into a coherent SQL query:            SELECT DISTINCT T2.results      FROM employee AS T1      INNER JOIN inspection AS T2 ON T1.employee_id = T2.employee_id      WHERE T2.inspection_date = '2010-02-24'      AND T1.first_name = 'Arnold'      AND T1.last_name = 'Holder';        By following these logical steps, we can effectively retrieve the desired inspection result for the specified date and employee.",,

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logical reasoning process that could be used to arrive at the solution:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to find inspection IDs where ""Rosemary Kennedy"" was involved. This implies that we need to connect the employee information with the inspection records.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - From the schema, identify that the `employee` table contains employee details, including `first_name` and `last_name`.    - The `inspection` table contains `inspection_id` and `employee_id`, which links to the employee involved in each inspection.  3. **Determine the Relationship Between Tables**:    - The `employee` table and the `inspection` table are related through the `employee_id` column. This relationship allows us to join these tables to find inspections conducted by a specific employee.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Start by selecting the necessary columns. We need `inspection_id` from the `inspection` table.    - Use an `INNER JOIN` to connect the `employee` table and the `inspection` table on the `employee_id` column.    - Apply a `WHERE` clause to filter records where the `first_name` is ""Rosemary"" and the `last_name` is ""Kennedy"".  5. **Ensure Uniqueness of Results**:    - Use `SELECT DISTINCT` to ensure that each `inspection_id` appears only once in the result set, even if there are multiple entries for the same inspection.  6. **Write the Final SQL Query**:    - Combine all these elements into the final SQL query:            SELECT DISTINCT T2.inspection_id      FROM employee AS T1      INNER JOIN inspection AS T2 ON T1.employee_id = T2.employee_id      WHERE T1.first_name = 'Rosemary' AND T1.last_name = 'Kennedy'        7. **Verify the Query**:    - Double-check that the query correctly joins the tables and filters based on the specified employee name.    - Ensure that the use of `DISTINCT` is appropriate to avoid duplicate inspection IDs.  By following these logical steps, we can systematically arrive at the solution to the SQL problem.",,

Here are the logical steps to arrive at the solution:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to find the inspection ID where the inspector's comment is ""MUST CLEAN AND BETTER ORGANIZE HALLWAY AREA"" and the sanitary operating requirement code is one of ""7-38-030, 015, 010 (A), 005 (A)"".  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**:    - The `violation` table contains the `inspector_comment` and `inspection_id`, which are directly related to our query.    - The `inspection_point` table contains the `code` that we need to match with the specified sanitary operating requirement code.  3. **Determine the Relationship Between Tables**:    - The `violation` table and the `inspection_point` table are related through the `point_id` column. This relationship allows us to join these tables to access both the `inspector_comment` and the `code`.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - We need to perform an INNER JOIN between `inspection_point` and `violation` tables on the `point_id` to combine relevant data.    - Use a WHERE clause to filter records where the `inspector_comment` matches ""MUST CLEAN AND BETTER ORGANIZE HALLWAY AREA"".    - Further filter the results where the `code` matches ""7-38-030, 015, 010 (A), 005 (A)"".  5. **Write the SQL Query**:    - The SQL query should select the `inspection_id` from the `violation` table after applying the necessary filters through a join with the `inspection_point` table.  6. **Verify the Query**:    - Ensure that the query logic correctly captures the conditions specified in the problem statement and that the join condition is correctly implemented.  Here is the formulated SQL query based on the above reasoning:   SELECT T2.inspection_id  FROM inspection_point AS T1  INNER JOIN violation AS T2 ON T1.point_id = T2.point_id  WHERE T2.inspector_comment = 'MUST CLEAN AND BETTER ORGANIZE HALLWAY AREA'  AND T1.code = '7-38-030, 015, 010 (A), 005 (A)'   This query effectively retrieves the `inspection_id` that meets all the specified conditions.",,

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logical reasoning that could lead to the solution:  1. **Understand the Problem Requirements:**    - We need to list the names of establishments.    - The establishments should have the highest risk level.    - The establishments should have failed the inspection.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns:**    - From the problem statement and schema, the relevant tables are `establishment` and `inspection`.    - From the `establishment` table, we need the `dba_name` and `risk_level`.    - From the `inspection` table, we need the `results` and `license_no` to join with the `establishment` table.  3. **Determine the Highest Risk Level:**    - According to the schema, the `risk_level` is a numerical value, where a higher number indicates a higher risk.    - We need to filter establishments with the highest risk level, which is 3 in this context.  4. **Filter Inspections with Failed Results:**    - We need to filter the inspections where the `results` column has the value 'Fail'.  5. **Join the Tables:**    - To get the required information, we need to join the `establishment` and `inspection` tables.    - The common column for joining these tables is `license_no`.  6. **Write the SQL Query:**    - Use an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `establishment` and `inspection` tables based on `license_no`.    - Apply the `WHERE` clause to filter rows where `risk_level` is 3 and `results` is 'Fail'.    - Use `SELECT DISTINCT` to ensure that each establishment name is listed only once, even if there are multiple failed inspections.  7. **Construct the Final Query:**    - The final SQL query is:            SELECT DISTINCT T1.dba_name      FROM establishment AS T1      INNER JOIN inspection AS T2 ON T1.license_no = T2.license_no      WHERE T1.risk_level = 3 AND T2.results = 'Fail';        By following these logical steps, we ensure that the query accurately retrieves the names of establishments that meet the specified criteria.",,

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logical reasoning process to arrive at the solution:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: We need to find the inspection ID for a specific employee (""David Hodges"") working at a specific establishment (""Kamayan Express""). This requires us to link information from multiple tables: `employee`, `establishment`, and `inspection`.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - **`employee` Table**: Contains employee details such as `employee_id`, `first_name`, and `last_name`. We will use this table to find ""David Hodges"".    - **`establishment` Table**: Contains establishment details including `license_no` and `dba_name`. We will use this table to find ""Kamayan Express"".    - **`inspection` Table**: Contains inspection details including `inspection_id`, `employee_id`, and `license_no`. This table will help us link the employee to the establishment and retrieve the inspection ID.  3. **Determine the Relationships Between Tables**:    - The `inspection` table links employees and establishments through `employee_id` and `license_no`.    - We need to join these tables to access the required information.  4. **Plan the SQL Query**:    - Start by joining the `establishment` table (`T1`) with the `inspection` table (`T2`) on `license_no` to filter records related to ""Kamayan Express"".    - Next, join the `inspection` table (`T2`) with the `employee` table (`T3`) on `employee_id` to filter records related to ""David Hodges"".  5. **Apply Filters**:    - Use a `WHERE` clause to filter employees with `first_name = 'David'` and `last_name = 'Hodges'`.    - Also, filter establishments with `dba_name = 'KAMAYAN EXPRESS'`.  6. **Select the Desired Output**:    - Select the `inspection_id` from the `inspection` table, which is the final piece of information needed.  7. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Combine the above steps into a coherent SQL query:            SELECT T2.inspection_id      FROM establishment AS T1      INNER JOIN inspection AS T2 ON T1.license_no = T2.license_no      INNER JOIN employee AS T3 ON T2.employee_id = T3.employee_id      WHERE T3.first_name = 'David'      AND T3.last_name = 'Hodges'      AND T1.dba_name = 'KAMAYAN EXPRESS'        By following these logical steps, we can effectively construct a query that retrieves the required inspection ID.",,

This allows us to find which employee was involved in a specific inspection.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Start by selecting the necessary columns: `salary` from the `employee` table.    - Use an `INNER JOIN` to connect the `employee` table with the `inspection` table on `employee_id` to filter the records to only those employees involved in inspections.    - Add a `WHERE` clause to filter the results to the specific `inspection_id` 58424.    - Use `ORDER BY` to sort the salaries in ascending order to find the salary range.    - Use `LIMIT 1` to ensure we only get the relevant salary range for the employee involved in the specific inspection.  5. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - The query should join the `employee` table with the `inspection` table on `employee_id`.    - Filter the results to only include the inspection with ID 58424.    - Select the salaries from the `employee` table, ordering them to find the range.  6. **Review and Optimize**:    - Ensure that the query is efficient and only retrieves the necessary data.    - Double-check that the logic aligns with the problem statement and that the query will return the desired salary range.  The final SQL query is:  SELECT T1.salary, T3.salary  FROM employee AS T1  INNER JOIN inspection AS T2 ON T1.employee_id = T2.employee_id  INNER JOIN employee AS T3  WHERE T2.inspection_id = 58424  ORDER BY T1.salary, T3.salary DESC  LIMIT 1;   This query effectively retrieves the salary range for the employee involved in the specified inspection by leveraging the relationships between the `inspection` and `employee` tables.",,

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement:**    - We need to list inspection IDs where the inspector's comment matches a specific text and the inspection category is ""Personnel.""  2. **Identify Relevant Tables:**    - From the schema, the tables that seem relevant are `inspection_point` and `violation`.    - `inspection_point` contains information about inspection categories.    - `violation` contains information about specific violations, including inspector comments and associated inspection IDs.  3. **Determine the Necessary Columns:**    - From `inspection_point`, we need the `category` column to filter by ""Personnel.""    - From `violation`, we need the `inspector_comment` column to match the specific comment, and the `inspection_id` column to retrieve the desired IDs.  4. **Establish Relationships Between Tables:**    - The `violation` table has a `point_id` that links to the `point_id` in the `inspection_point` table. This relationship allows us to join these tables and filter based on the category and comments.  5. **Formulate the SQL Query:**    - Use an INNER JOIN to combine `inspection_point` and `violation` on the `point_id` column.    - Apply a WHERE clause to filter:      - `T1.category = 'Personnel'` to ensure we only consider personnel-related inspections.      - `T2.inspector_comment = 'A certified food service manager must be present in all establishments at which potentially hazardous food is prepared or served. NO CERTIFIED FOOD MANAGER ON DUTY AT THIS TIME FOODS ARE COOKED AND SERVED SERIOUS CITATION ISSUED'` to match the specific comment provided in the problem.  6. **Select the Required Output:**    - The query should select `T2.inspection_id` as this is the desired output according to the problem statement.  By following these logical steps, we can construct the SQL query to retrieve the inspection IDs that meet the specified criteria.",,

The relevant tables for this problem are `establishment`, `inspection`, `violation`, and `inspection_point`.  2. **Identify the Key Columns**:    - From `establishment`, we need `dba_name` to filter for ""J & J FOOD"" and `license_no` to join with `inspection`.    - From `inspection`, we need `license_no` to join with `establishment` and `inspection_id` to join with `violation`.    - From `violation`, we need `inspection_id` to join with `inspection` and `point_id` to join with `inspection_point`.    - From `inspection_point`, we need `point_id` to join with `violation` and `category` to get the desired output.  3. **Establish the Relationships**:    - `establishment` is linked to `inspection` through `license_no`.    - `inspection` is linked to `violation` through `inspection_id`.    - `violation` is linked to `inspection_point` through `point_id`.  4. **Formulate the Query**:    - Start by filtering the `establishment` table to find the row where `dba_name` is ""J & J FOOD"".    - Use the `license_no` from this row to find corresponding inspections in the `inspection` table.    - Use the `inspection_id` from these inspections to find related violations in the `violation` table.    - Use the `point_id` from these violations to find the corresponding categories in the `inspection_point` table.  5. **Select the Required Information**:    - We are interested in the `category` from the `inspection_point` table. Use `DISTINCT` to ensure each category is listed only once if there are multiple violations with the same category.  6. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Join the tables in the order of their relationships: `establishment` -> `inspection` -> `violation` -> `inspection_point`.    - Apply the filter for `dba_name` to get the specific establishment.    - Select the distinct `category` from the `inspection_point` table.

Here are the logical steps that could have been taken to reach the solution:  1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to find the names of taverns that failed their inspections in January 2010. This requires filtering data based on specific conditions: inspection results, inspection date, and facility type.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**: From the schema provided, the relevant tables are:    - `establishment`: Contains information about the establishments, including their names and facility types.    - `inspection`: Contains details about inspections, including dates and results.    - `violation`: Contains information about violations, which can be used to confirm inspection failures.  3. **Determine Necessary Joins**:     - Join `establishment` and `inspection` on the `license_no` column to connect establishments with their inspections.    - Join `inspection` and `violation` on the `inspection_id` column to ensure we are considering inspections with recorded violations.  4. **Filter by Date**:     - Use the `inspection_date` column from the `inspection` table to filter inspections that occurred in January 2010. This can be achieved by formatting the date to 'YYYY-MM' and checking if it equals '2010-01'.  5. **Filter by Inspection Result**:     - Ensure that the `results` column in the `inspection` table indicates a 'Fail'. This identifies inspections where the establishment did not meet the required standards.  6. **Filter by Facility Type**:     - Use the `facility_type` column in the `establishment` table to filter for taverns specifically.  7. **Select Distinct Establishment Names**:     - Use `SELECT DISTINCT` to retrieve unique names of taverns (`dba_name`) that meet all the above conditions.  8. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Combine all the above steps into a single SQL query that performs the necessary joins and applies the filters.  Here is the final SQL query based on these steps:   SELECT DISTINCT T1.dba_name  FROM establishment AS T1  INNER JOIN inspection AS T2 ON T1.license_no = T2.license_no  INNER JOIN violation AS T3 ON T2.inspection_id = T3.inspection_id  WHERE strftime('%Y-%m', T2.inspection_date) = '2010-01'  AND T2.results = 'Fail'  AND T1.facility_type = 'TAVERN';   By following these logical steps, we ensure that we accurately identify the taverns that failed inspections in the specified time frame.",,

Here is the SQL query that implements these steps:   SELECT      COUNT(CASE WHEN T2.results = 'Pass' THEN T1.license_no END) -      COUNT(CASE WHEN T2.results = 'Fail' THEN T1.license_no END) AS diff FROM      establishment AS T1 INNER JOIN      inspection AS T2 ON T1.license_no = T2.license_no WHERE      T2.inspection_type = 'Canvass'      AND T1.facility_type = 'Restaurant';   By following these logical steps, we ensure that we accurately calculate the difference in the number of restaurants that passed and failed the canvass inspection type.",,

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to find the names of employees who were involved in inspections that failed in February 2010.    - Additionally, these employees must have a salary greater than 70% of the average salary of all employees.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - **employee**: We need `employee_id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, and `salary`.    - **inspection**: We need `inspection_date`, `results`, and `employee_id`.    - We are not directly using the `establishment`, `inspection_point`, or `violation` tables for this query.  3. **Filter Inspections by Date and Result**:    - We need to filter inspections that occurred in February 2010 and resulted in a ""Fail"".    - Use the `inspection_date` column to filter by month and year.    - Use the `results` column to filter for ""Fail"".  4. **Calculate the Average Salary**:    - Use the `employee` table to calculate the average salary of all employees.    - This will be used to determine the 70% threshold.  5. **Filter Employees by Salary**:    - Compare each employee's salary to 70% of the average salary calculated in the previous step.    - Only include employees whose salary is greater than this threshold.  6. **Join Tables**:    - Join the `employee` and `inspection` tables on `employee_id` to link employees to their inspection results.  7. **Select and Distinct**:    - Select the `employee_id` of employees who meet the criteria.    - Use `DISTINCT` to ensure each employee is listed only once, even if they were involved in multiple failed inspections.  8. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Combine the above steps into a coherent SQL query:   SELECT DISTINCT T1.employee_id  FROM employee AS T1  INNER JOIN inspection AS T2  ON T1.employee_id = T2.employee_id  WHERE T2.results = 'Fail'  AND strftime('%Y-%m', T2.inspection_date) = '2010-02'  AND T1.salary > 0.7 * (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employee);   9. **Verify the Query**:    - Ensure the query logic aligns with the problem requirements.    - Check for correct use of SQL functions and syntax.

This filter will be applied to the `violation` table.  5. **Join Tables to Aggregate Data:**    - Join `establishment` and `inspection` on `license_no` to associate establishments with their inspections.    - Join the result with `violation` on `inspection_id` to associate inspections with their violations.  6. **Calculate the Total Number of Establishments with a 500 Fine:**    - After joining, count the total number of unique establishments (using `license_no`) that have a violation with a 500 fine.  7. **Calculate the Number of Restaurants with a 500 Fine:**    - Use a conditional count to determine how many of these establishments have `facility_type` as 'Restaurant'.  8. **Compute the Percentage:**    - Calculate the percentage by dividing the number of restaurants by the total number of establishments with a 500 fine and multiplying by 100.  9. **Formulate the SQL Query:**    - Use SQL to implement the above logic:            SELECT CAST(COUNT(CASE WHEN T1.facility_type = 'Restaurant' THEN T1.license_no END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(T1.facility_type)      FROM establishment AS T1      INNER JOIN inspection AS T2 ON T1.license_no = T2.license_no      INNER JOIN violation AS T3 ON T2.inspection_id = T3.inspection_id      WHERE T3.fine = 500;          - This query calculates the percentage of restaurants by counting the number of restaurant establishments and dividing by the total number of establishments that paid a 500 fine.  By following these logical steps, we can systematically approach the problem and derive the correct SQL query to find the desired percentage.",,

This involves calculating the maximum market capitalization for the filtered records.  5. **Join Tables to Get Coin Name**:    - After identifying the record with the maximum market capitalization, we need to join the `historical` table with the `coins` table to get the corresponding coin name. This requires matching the `coin_id` from the `historical` table with the `id` from the `coins` table.  6. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Use an inner join between the `coins` and `historical` tables.    - Apply a filter to the `historical` table to select records from 2018.    - Use a subquery to find the maximum market capitalization for 2018.    - Select the `name` from the `coins` table where the `market_cap` matches the maximum value found.  7. **Construct the Final Query**:    - The SQL query is constructed as follows:            SELECT T1.name       FROM coins AS T1       INNER JOIN historical AS T2       ON T1.id = T2.coin_id       WHERE T2.date LIKE '2018%'       AND T2.market_cap = (        SELECT MAX(market_cap)         FROM historical         WHERE STRFTIME('%Y', date) = '2018'      )        By following these logical steps, we can effectively solve the problem and identify the coin with the highest market capitalization for the year 2018.",,

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to list the price of Zetacoin for a specific date range (13/11/1 to the next 7 consecutive days).    - Calculate the average price for these 7 days.  2. **Analyze the Schema**:    - We have two tables: `coins` and `historical`.    - The `coins` table contains information about different cryptocurrencies, including their names and IDs.    - The `historical` table contains historical data about these cryptocurrencies, including their prices on different dates.  3. **Identify Relevant Columns**:    - From the `coins` table, we need the `name` and `id` columns to identify Zetacoin.    - From the `historical` table, we need the `date`, `coin_id`, and `price` columns to filter and retrieve price data for Zetacoin.  4. **Determine the Date Range**:    - The problem specifies the date range as 13/11/1 to the next 7 consecutive days. However, the solution uses '2013-11-01' to '2013-11-07'. This discrepancy suggests a possible typo in the problem statement, and we assume the solution's date range is correct.  5. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - **Join the Tables**: Use an INNER JOIN between `coins` and `historical` on the `id` and `coin_id` columns to link the two tables.    - **Filter by Coin Name**: Use a WHERE clause to filter for rows where the `name` is 'Zetacoin'.    - **Filter by Date Range**: Use a WHERE clause to filter for rows where the `date` is between '2013-11-01' and '2013-11-07'.    - **Select Prices**: Select the `price` column from the filtered results.    - **Calculate Average Price**: Use the AVG() function to calculate the average price over the specified date range.  6. **Combine Results**:    - Use a UNION ALL to combine the list of prices with the calculated average price in a single query.  7. **Construct the Final Query**:    - The final query is constructed by combining the steps above into a coherent SQL statement that retrieves the required information.  By following these logical steps, we arrive at the solution provided, which effectively lists the prices for Zetacoin over the specified date range and calculates the average price for those days.",,

We have two tables: `coins` and `historical`.    - The `coins` table contains information about different cryptocurrencies, including their `id`, `name`, and other metadata.    - The `historical` table contains historical transaction data, including `date`, `coin_id`, and `price`.  2. **Identify the Relevant Data**:    - We need to find the transaction date for DigixDAO when it was transacted at the highest price.    - This involves identifying the `coin_id` for DigixDAO from the `coins` table and then finding the corresponding entries in the `historical` table.  3. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - **Join the Tables**: Use an INNER JOIN to combine the `coins` and `historical` tables based on the `id` from `coins` and `coin_id` from `historical`. This allows us to access both the name of the coin and its historical prices.    - **Filter for DigixDAO**: Add a WHERE clause to filter the results to only include rows where the `name` column in the `coins` table is 'DigixDAO'.    - **Sort by Price**: Use ORDER BY to sort the results by the `price` column in descending order. This ensures that the highest price appears first.    - **Select the Date**: Use SELECT to retrieve the `date` column from the `historical` table, which corresponds to the highest price.    - **Limit the Results**: Use LIMIT 1 to ensure that only the top result (i.e., the highest price) is returned.  4. **Construct the Final Query**:    - Combine all the above steps into a single SQL query:            SELECT T2.date       FROM coins AS T1       INNER JOIN historical AS T2       ON T1.id = T2.coin_id       WHERE T1.name = 'DigixDAO'       ORDER BY T2.price DESC       LIMIT 1;        5. **Verify the Solution**:    - Ensure that the query correctly identifies the date when DigixDAO was transacted at the highest price by checking against sample data or running the query in a test environment.

This can be done using the `STRFTIME` function to extract the year from the `date` column.  5. **Calculate the Average**:    - Sum the `circulating_supply` values for the filtered data to get the total circulating supply for the year 2014.    - Divide this total by 12 to get the average monthly circulating supply, assuming data is available for each month.  6. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Use the `SELECT` statement to calculate and return the average monthly circulating supply.    - Use `CAST` to ensure the division result is returned as a real number.  By following these steps, we can construct the SQL query to solve the problem:   SELECT CAST(SUM(T2.circulating_supply) AS REAL) / 12  FROM coins AS T1  INNER JOIN historical AS T2  ON T1.id = T2.coin_id  WHERE T1.name = 'Frozen'  AND STRFTIME('%Y', T2.date) = '2014'   This query will provide the average monthly circulating supply for ""Frozen"" in 2014.",,

This can be done using a `WHERE` clause.  4. **Join Tables**:    - To find the transaction dates for the inactive coins, we need to join the `coins` table with the `historical` table.    - Use an `INNER JOIN` on the `id` column from the `coins` table and the `coin_id` column from the `historical` table to link the two tables.  5. **Select Required Columns**:    - From the joined result, select the name of the coin from the `coins` table and the date of the transaction from the `historical` table.  6. **Find the Last Transaction Date**:    - Use the `MAX()` function to get the latest transaction date for each inactive coin.  7. **Order the Results**:    - Although the problem does not explicitly require ordering, it is common to order results by date to ensure clarity. Use `ORDER BY T2.DATE DESC` to order the results by the transaction date in descending order.  8. **Limit the Results**:    - The problem statement does not specify limiting the results to a single entry, but the solution uses `LIMIT 1`. This implies that only the most recent transaction date for the last inactive coin is needed. This might be a misunderstanding or an error in the solution, as typically, you would want to list all inactive coins with their last transaction date.  9. **Final Query**:    - Combine all these steps into the final SQL query:            SELECT T1.NAME, MAX(T2.DATE)       FROM coins AS T1       INNER JOIN historical AS T2 ON T1.ID = T2.coin_id       WHERE T1.status = 'inactive'       GROUP BY T1.NAME      ORDER BY MAX(T2.DATE) DESC;          - Note: The `LIMIT 1` in the original solution seems incorrect if the goal is to list all inactive coins. Therefore, it is omitted in the final query to ensure all inactive coins are listed with their last transaction date.",,

This relationship allows us to join these tables.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - **Join the Tables**: Use an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `coins` and `historical` tables based on the matching `id` and `coin_id`.    - **Filter for Bitcoin**: Add a `WHERE` clause to filter records where the `name` is 'Bitcoin'.    - **Filter for the Year 2016**: Use the `STRFTIME` function to extract the year from the `date` column and filter for the year 2016.    - **Calculate the Average Price**: Use the `AVG` function to compute the average of the `price` column for the filtered records.  5. **Write the SQL Query**:    - The final SQL query is:            SELECT AVG(T2.price)      FROM coins AS T1      INNER JOIN historical AS T2 ON T1.id = T2.coin_id      WHERE T1.name = 'Bitcoin' AND STRFTIME('%Y', T2.date) = '2016'        6. **Verify the Solution**:    - Ensure the query logic aligns with the problem requirements.    - Check that the query correctly joins the tables, filters for Bitcoin and the year 2016, and calculates the average price.  By following these steps, we logically arrive at the solution to determine the average price of 1 Bitcoin in 2016 using the given schema and data.",,

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the logical reasoning process to arrive at the solution:  1. **Understand the Schema and Problem Requirements**:    - We have two tables: `coins` and `historical`.    - The `coins` table contains information about each coin, including its `status`.    - The `historical` table contains historical price data for each coin, identified by `coin_id`.    - We need to find coins with an average price greater than $1000 and return their current `status`.  2. **Identify Relevant Columns**:    - From the `coins` table, the relevant columns are `id` (to join with `historical`) and `status` (to return as the result).    - From the `historical` table, the relevant columns are `coin_id` (to join with `coins`) and `price` (to calculate the average price).  3. **Determine the Relationship Between Tables**:    - The `coins` table can be joined with the `historical` table using `coins.id = historical.coin_id`.  4. **Calculate the Average Price**:    - We need to calculate the average price for each coin. This requires grouping the data by coin.    - Use the `AVG()` function on the `price` column from the `historical` table to compute the average price for each coin.  5. **Filter Coins by Average Price**:    - After calculating the average price, we need to filter the results to include only those coins with an average price greater than $1000.    - Use the `HAVING` clause to filter groups based on the average price condition.  6. **Select the Required Output**:    - Once we have filtered the coins, we need to select the `status` of these coins from the `coins` table.  7. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Combine all the above steps into a single SQL query:            SELECT T1.status      FROM coins AS T1      INNER JOIN historical AS T2 ON T1.id = T2.coin_id      GROUP BY T1.name      HAVING AVG(T2.price) > 1000           - The query performs an inner join between the `coins` and `historical` tables, groups the results by coin name, calculates the average price for each coin, filters coins with an average price greater than $1000, and finally selects the `status` of these coins.  By following these logical steps, we can effectively solve the problem and construct the correct SQL query to obtain the desired results.",,

This means we are looking for the minimum value in the `percent_change_1h` column from the `historical` table.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - The `coins` table contains information about each coin, including its `id` and `name`.    - The `historical` table contains historical data for each coin, including `date`, `coin_id`, and `percent_change_1h`.  3. **Determine the Relationship Between Tables**: The `coins` table and the `historical` table are related through the `id` column in `coins` and the `coin_id` column in `historical`. This relationship allows us to join these tables to get the name of the coin corresponding to each historical record.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - **Step 1**: Use an INNER JOIN to combine the `coins` and `historical` tables based on the matching `id` and `coin_id` columns. This will allow us to access both the coin's name and its historical data in a single query.    - **Step 2**: Identify the record with the greatest decline in `percent_change_1h`. This is done by finding the minimum value of `percent_change_1h` in the `historical` table.    - **Step 3**: Use a subquery to find the minimum `percent_change_1h` value. This subquery will help us filter the records to only those with the greatest decline.    - **Step 4**: Select the `name` from the `coins` table and the `date` from the `historical` table where the `percent_change_1h` matches the minimum value found in the subquery.  5. **Write the SQL Query**:    - The final SQL query is structured as follows:            SELECT T1.name, T2.date      FROM coins AS T1      INNER JOIN historical AS T2 ON T1.id = T2.coin_id      WHERE T2.percent_change_1h = (        SELECT MIN(percent_change_1h) FROM historical      )        6. **Verify the Query**: Ensure that the query correctly joins the tables and filters the records to find the coin and date with the greatest decline in 1-hour percent change.  By following these steps, we can logically arrive at the solution to the problem, ensuring that we correctly identify the coin and date with the greatest decline in percent change in 1 hour.",,

Here is the corrected SQL query based on these steps:   SELECT T1.name  FROM coins AS T1  INNER JOIN historical AS T2  ON T1.id = T2.coin_id  WHERE T2.date = '2013-06-22'  GROUP BY T1.name  HAVING AVG(T2.percent_change_24h) > (     SELECT AVG(percent_change_24h)      FROM historical      WHERE date = '2013-06-22' );   This query correctly identifies the coins with a higher than average percentage price change on the specified date.",,

This requires identifying the relevant data columns and tables that contain this information.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - From the schema, we see that there are two tables: `coins` and `historical`.    - The `coins` table contains information about different cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, with columns such as `id`, `name`, and `slug`.    - The `historical` table contains historical data about these cryptocurrencies, including columns like `date`, `coin_id`, and `close`.  3. **Determine the Relationship Between Tables**:    - The `coins` table has a primary key `id` which corresponds to the `coin_id` in the `historical` table. This relationship allows us to join these tables to get historical data for a specific cryptocurrency.  4. **Formulate the Query**:    - We need to join the `coins` and `historical` tables on the `id` and `coin_id` columns, respectively, to combine the data from both tables.    - We are interested in the `close` column from the `historical` table, which represents the closing price of Bitcoin.  5. **Filter the Data**:    - Use a `WHERE` clause to filter the data to include only the row where the `date` is '2013-04-29' and the `name` in the `coins` table is 'Bitcoin'. This ensures we are looking at the correct cryptocurrency and date.  6. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Based on the above steps, the SQL query would be:            SELECT T2.close       FROM coins AS T1       INNER JOIN historical AS T2       ON T1.id = T2.coin_id       WHERE T2.date = '2013-04-29'       AND T1.name = 'Bitcoin';        7. **Validate the Query**:    - Ensure that the query correctly retrieves the closing price for Bitcoin on the specified date by checking the logic and the schema details.  By following these logical steps, we arrive at the solution to the problem, ensuring that the query is both accurate and efficient.",,

Profit in trading is typically calculated as the difference between the highest price (high) and the lowest price (low) of the asset within a given time frame.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:     - From the `coins` table, we need to identify Bitcoin. The relevant columns here are `id` and `name`.    - From the `historical` table, we need to find the price data for Bitcoin on the specified date. The relevant columns here are `date`, `coin_id`, `high`, and `low`.  3. **Determine the Relationship Between Tables**:     - The `coins` table contains information about different cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin.    - The `historical` table contains historical price data for these cryptocurrencies, linked by `coin_id` which corresponds to `id` in the `coins` table.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - **Join the Tables**: Use an INNER JOIN to combine data from the `coins` and `historical` tables based on the matching `id` and `coin_id`.    - **Filter by Date and Cryptocurrency**: Use a WHERE clause to filter the records for the date '2013-04-28' and for Bitcoin specifically by checking `name = 'Bitcoin'`.    - **Calculate the Profit**: Select the difference between the `high` and `low` prices from the `historical` table to calculate the maximum profit.  5. **Write the SQL Query**:    - The SQL query is structured to join the tables, apply the necessary filters, and compute the desired profit:            SELECT T2.high - T2.low       FROM coins AS T1       INNER JOIN historical AS T2       ON T1.id = T2.coin_id       WHERE T2.date = '2013-04-28'       AND T1.name = 'Bitcoin'        6. **Verify the Solution**:    - Ensure that the query correctly identifies Bitcoin and retrieves the high and low prices for the specified date.    - Confirm that the calculation of `high - low` accurately represents the maximum potential profit for that day.  By following these logical steps, we can systematically arrive at the solution to the problem, ensuring that all necessary data is correctly utilized and the query is constructed to yield the desired result.",,

This can be calculated as the difference between the maximum supply and the total supply of Bitcoins at a given date.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - We have two tables: `coins` and `historical`.    - The `coins` table contains metadata about different cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin.    - The `historical` table contains historical data about these cryptocurrencies, such as market cap, price, and supply information on specific dates.  3. **Determine the Necessary Data**:    - We need to find the maximum supply and total supply of Bitcoin on the specified date (2013/4/28).    - The `historical` table contains the `max_supply` and `total_supply` columns, which are essential for our calculation.  4. **Filter for Bitcoin Data**:    - Use the `coins` table to identify the row corresponding to Bitcoin. This can be done by filtering where the `name` column is 'Bitcoin'.    - The `id` column in the `coins` table can be used to join with the `coin_id` column in the `historical` table to get the relevant historical data for Bitcoin.  5. **Filter by Date**:    - We are interested in data as of 2013/4/28, so we need to filter the `historical` table for this specific date.  6. **Calculate Burned Bitcoins**:    - Once we have the relevant row from the `historical` table for Bitcoin on 2013/4/28, calculate the number of burned Bitcoins by subtracting the `total_supply` from the `max_supply`.  7. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Use an SQL query to perform the above steps:            SELECT T2.max_supply - T2.total_supply       FROM coins AS T1       INNER JOIN historical AS T2 ON T1.id = T2.coin_id       WHERE T2.date = '2013-04-28' AND T1.name = 'Bitcoin'        8. **Execute and Interpret the Result**:    - The result of the query will give the number of Bitcoins that were verifiably burned as of 2013/4/28.

The trading value is represented by the `volume_24h` column in the `historical` table.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - The `coins` table contains information about each cryptocurrency, including its `id` and `name`.    - The `historical` table contains daily trading data, including `date`, `coin_id`, and `volume_24h`.  3. **Determine the Key Relationships**:    - The `coins` table can be linked to the `historical` table through the `id` column in `coins` and the `coin_id` column in `historical`. This relationship allows us to match each cryptocurrency with its corresponding trading data.  4. **Filter Data for the Specific Date**:    - We need to focus on the data from January 8, 2016. This means filtering the `historical` table to only include rows where the `date` is '2016-01-08'.  5. **Identify the Maximum Trading Volume**:    - To find the cryptocurrency with the highest trading value, we need to determine the maximum value in the `volume_24h` column for the specified date. This can be achieved using the `MAX()` function in SQL.  6. **Select the Cryptocurrency with the Maximum Trading Volume**:    - Once we have the maximum trading volume, we need to identify which cryptocurrency corresponds to this value. This requires an inner query to find the maximum `volume_24h` and then matching it with the corresponding `coin_id`.  7. **Join Tables to Retrieve Cryptocurrency Name**:    - Use an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `coins` and `historical` tables based on the matching `id` and `coin_id`. This allows us to retrieve the `name` of the cryptocurrency that has the highest trading volume.  8. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Combine all the steps into a single SQL query:            SELECT T1.name       FROM coins AS T1       INNER JOIN historical AS T2       ON T1.id = T2.coin_id       WHERE T2.date = '2016-01-08'       AND T2.volume_24h = (        SELECT MAX(volume_24h)         FROM historical         WHERE date = '2016-01-08'      )        By following these logical steps, we arrive at the SQL query that correctly identifies the cryptocurrency with the highest trading value on January 8, 2016.",,

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logical reasoning to arrive at the solution:  1. **Understand the Schema and Requirements**:    - We have two tables: `coins` and `historical`.    - The `coins` table contains information about each cryptocurrency, including its name and ID.    - The `historical` table contains historical data about cryptocurrencies, including the date, coin ID, and total supply.    - The task is to find cryptocurrencies with a total supply greater than 10,000,000 on 2013/4/28.  2. **Identify Relevant Columns**:    - From the `coins` table, we need the `name` column to list the names of cryptocurrencies.    - From the `historical` table, we need the `date`, `coin_id`, and `total_supply` columns to filter and match the criteria.  3. **Determine the Join Condition**:    - To link data from the `coins` table with the `historical` table, we need to use the `id` column from `coins` and the `coin_id` column from `historical`.    - This will allow us to associate each cryptocurrency's name with its historical data.  4. **Set the Date Filter**:    - We need to filter the records in the `historical` table to only consider data from the specific date, 2013/4/28.    - This is done using a `WHERE` clause on the `date` column.  5. **Apply the Total Supply Condition**:    - We need to further filter the records to only include cryptocurrencies with a `total_supply` greater than 10,000,000.    - This condition is also added to the `WHERE` clause.  6. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Use an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `coins` and `historical` tables based on the matching `id` and `coin_id`.    - Apply the filters for the date and total supply in the `WHERE` clause.    - Select the `name` column from the `coins` table to get the desired output.  7. **Write the Final Query**:    - The final SQL query is:            SELECT T1.name       FROM coins AS T1       INNER JOIN historical AS T2       ON T1.id = T2.coin_id       WHERE T2.date = '2013-04-28'       AND T2.total_supply > 10000000        By following these logical steps, we can effectively query the database to retrieve the names of cryptocurrencies that meet the specified criteria.",,

This requires identifying the correct data points from the provided tables.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**: From the schema, we have two tables: `coins` and `historical`. The `coins` table contains information about different cryptocurrencies, while the `historical` table contains historical data such as price, market cap, etc., for these coins on specific dates.  3. **Determine Necessary Columns**:    - From the `coins` table, we need the `name` column to identify Bitcoin.    - From the `historical` table, we need the `date` and `price` columns to find the price of Bitcoin on the specified date.  4. **Establish Relationships**: The `historical` table has a `coin_id` column that corresponds to the `id` column in the `coins` table. This relationship allows us to join these tables and match the historical data to the correct cryptocurrency.  5. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - **Join the Tables**: Use an INNER JOIN to combine the `coins` and `historical` tables based on the matching `id` and `coin_id` columns.    - **Filter by Date**: Use a WHERE clause to filter the `historical` table for the date '2013-04-28'.    - **Filter by Coin Name**: Further filter the results to only include data where the `name` in the `coins` table is 'Bitcoin'.    - **Select the Price**: Finally, select the `price` column from the `historical` table, which will give us the price of Bitcoin on the specified date.  6. **Construct the SQL Query**: Based on the above steps, the SQL query is constructed as follows:        SELECT T2.price    FROM coins AS T1    INNER JOIN historical AS T2 ON T1.id = T2.coin_id    WHERE T2.date = '2013-04-28' AND T1.name = 'Bitcoin';      By following these steps, we logically arrive at the solution to find the price of Bitcoin on 2013/4/28 using the given schema.",,

From the `coins` table, identify Bitcoin using the `name` column.  4. **Determine Relevant Date**:    - We are interested in data before 2018/4/28. This will be used to filter the historical data.  5. **Join Tables**:    - Use an INNER JOIN between the `coins` table and the `historical` table on the `id` column from `coins` and `coin_id` from `historical` to get relevant historical data for Bitcoin.  6. **Filter Data**:    - Filter the joined data to include only records where the `date` is before 2018/4/28 and where the `name` is 'Bitcoin'.  7. **Calculate Burned Bitcoins**:    - For Bitcoin, calculate the difference between `max_supply` and `total_supply` from the `historical` table. This difference represents the number of Bitcoins that are considered verifiably burned.  8. **Calculate Percentage**:    - Compute the percentage of burned Bitcoins relative to the `total_supply`. This is done by dividing the number of burned Bitcoins by the `total_supply` and multiplying by 100 to get a percentage.  9. **Formulate SQL Query**:    - Construct the SQL query to perform these calculations:            SELECT CAST((SUM(T2.max_supply) - SUM(T2.total_supply)) AS REAL) / SUM(T2.total_supply)      FROM coins AS T1      INNER JOIN historical AS T2 ON T1.id = T2.coin_id      WHERE T2.date < '2018-04-28' AND T1.name = 'Bitcoin'        10. **Execute and Interpret**:     - Execute the query to get the result, which is the percentage of Bitcoins verifiably burned until the specified date.  By following these steps, you can systematically approach the problem and derive the solution using SQL.",,

We have two tables: `coins` and `historical`. The `coins` table contains information about each coin, including its `status`, while the `historical` table contains historical data about the coins.  3. **Identify Relevant Columns**: From the `coins` table, the `status` column is crucial because it indicates the current state of the coin (e.g., active, inactive, extinct). The `name` column is also important because it contains the names of the coins, which is the information we need to extract.  4. **Determine the Condition for Disappearance**: Based on typical conventions, a coin that has ""disappeared"" is likely to have a status indicating it is no longer active. In this context, the status 'extinct' would logically represent a disappeared coin.  5. **Formulate the SQL Query**: With the understanding that the `status` column indicates the state of the coin, we can write a query to select the names of coins where the status is 'extinct'.  6. **Write the SQL Query**:         SELECT name FROM coins WHERE status = 'extinct';      7. **Verify the Solution**: Ensure that the query correctly identifies and lists the names of all coins with the status 'extinct'. This involves checking that the query syntax is correct and that it logically aligns with the problem requirements.  By following these steps, we can systematically arrive at the solution to list the names of coins that have disappeared.",,

The `date_added` column is in a datetime format, so we'll need to extract the year and month to perform this filter.    - Use the `STRFTIME` function to extract the year and month from `date_added` and compare it to '2013-05'.  4. **Count the Coins**:    - Use the `COUNT` function to determine how many coins were added in May 2013. This will give us the total number of coins added during that month.  5. **List the Coin Names**:    - Select the `name` of each coin that was added in May 2013. This will provide a list of the coin names.  6. **Combine Results**:    - Use a `UNION ALL` to combine the results of the count and the list of names. This allows us to present both the number of coins and their names in a single query result.  7. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Combine the above logical steps into a single SQL query:            SELECT COUNT(id) AS num       FROM coins       WHERE STRFTIME('%Y-%m', date_added) = '2013-05'      UNION ALL       SELECT name       FROM coins       WHERE STRFTIME('%Y-%m', date_added) = '2013-05';        By following these steps, we can effectively solve the problem by filtering the data based on the date, counting the entries, and listing the names of the coins added in the specified month and year.",,

Here’s a breakdown of how we can arrive at the solution:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to identify coins that cannot be traded in the year 2014. This implies that these coins were either not active or not listed during that year.  2. **Analyze the Schema**:     - We have two tables: `coins` and `historical`.    - The `coins` table contains information about each coin, including its `name`, `status`, and `date_added`.    - The `historical` table records historical data for each coin, including the `date` and `coin_id`.  3. **Identify Relevant Columns**:    - From the `coins` table, the relevant columns are `name`, `status`, and `date_added`.    - From the `historical` table, the relevant column is `date`.  4. **Determine Criteria for Non-Tradable Coins**:    - A coin cannot be traded in 2014 if it was not active or not listed during that year.    - We need to check if the `date_added` for a coin is in 2014 and if its `status` is not 'active'.  5. **Formulate the Query**:    - We need to filter coins where the `date_added` is in the year 2014. This can be done using a condition like `date_added LIKE '2014%'`.    - Additionally, we need to ensure that the `status` is 'untracked' or any other status indicating non-tradability.  6. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Based on the above criteria, the SQL query would be:            SELECT name FROM coins WHERE date_added LIKE '2014%' AND status = 'untracked';          - This query selects the `name` of coins from the `coins` table where the `date_added` is in 2014 and the `status` is 'untracked', indicating they cannot be traded.  7. **Verify the Solution**:    - Ensure that the query correctly identifies coins based on the specified conditions.    - Check if there are any additional conditions or columns that might affect the tradability of coins in 2014.  By following these steps, we logically deduce the solution to the problem, ensuring that we correctly identify coins that were not tradable in 2014 based on the available schema and data.",,

We need to focus on this column to determine the number of tags for each coin.  3. **Determine the Number of Tags**:    - To find out how many tags a coin has, we can count the number of commas in the `tag_names` string. Each comma separates two tags, so the number of tags is one more than the number of commas.  4. **Formulate the Logic**:    - If a coin has three tags, there should be two commas in the `tag_names` string. Therefore, we need to find entries where the number of commas is exactly two.  5. **Implement the Logic in SQL**:    - Use the `LENGTH` function to get the total length of the `tag_names` string.    - Use the `REPLACE` function to remove all commas from the `tag_names` string and then use `LENGTH` again to get the length of this modified string.    - The difference between the original length and the modified length gives the number of commas.    - We need this difference to be exactly 2, indicating three tags.  6. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Construct the SQL query to select the `name` of coins where the difference in lengths (i.e., the number of commas) is 2.   SELECT name  FROM coins  WHERE LENGTH(tag_names) - LENGTH(REPLACE(tag_names, ',', '')) = 2;   7. **Verify and Test**:    - Ensure that the query correctly identifies coins with exactly three tags by testing it against sample data or a test database.  By following these steps, we can logically derive the solution to identify coins with exactly three tags using SQL.",,

Here's a logical breakdown of the steps to arrive at the SQL solution:  1. **Understand the Problem**: The goal is to find the best time to purchase Bitcoin, which implies identifying the date when Bitcoin's price was at its lowest.  2. **Examine the Schema**:     - The `coins` table contains information about different cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin.    - The `historical` table provides historical data on these cryptocurrencies, including their prices on different dates.  3. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - From the `coins` table, we need to identify Bitcoin. The relevant columns are `id` (to uniquely identify Bitcoin) and `name` (to filter for Bitcoin).    - From the `historical` table, we need the `date` and `low` columns. The `date` column tells us when the price was recorded, and the `low` column indicates the lowest price for that date.  4. **Formulate the Query**:    - **Join the Tables**: We need to join the `coins` and `historical` tables to access the historical price data for Bitcoin. The join condition is `T1.id = T2.coin_id`, where `T1` is the alias for `coins` and `T2` is the alias for `historical`.    - **Filter for Bitcoin**: Use a `WHERE` clause to filter the `coins` table for Bitcoin specifically (`T1.name = 'Bitcoin'`).    - **Order by Lowest Price**: To find the date when Bitcoin's price was at its lowest, order the results by the `low` column in ascending order (`ORDER BY T2.low`).    - **Limit the Results**: Since we only need the date of the lowest price, limit the results to one (`LIMIT 1`).  5. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Combine the above steps into a complete SQL query:            SELECT T2.date       FROM coins AS T1       INNER JOIN historical AS T2       ON T1.id = T2.coin_id       WHERE T1.name = 'Bitcoin'       ORDER BY T2.low       LIMIT 1        6. **Verify the Solution**: Ensure that the query correctly identifies the date with the lowest recorded price for Bitcoin by checking the data and logic.  By following these steps, we logically deduce the SQL query needed to find the best time to purchase Bitcoin based on historical price data.",,

This relationship allows us to join these tables.  5. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Use an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `coins` and `historical` tables based on the matching `id` and `coin_id`.    - Filter the records to include only those where the `date` is in May 2013. This can be done using the `STRFTIME` function to extract the year and month from the `date` column and compare it to '2013-05'.    - Further filter the records to include only those where the `open` column is `NULL`, indicating that the coin was not opened during that time.  6. **Select the Desired Output**: Finally, select the `name` column from the `coins` table to get the names of the coins that meet the criteria.  7. **Write the SQL Query**:        SELECT T1.name    FROM coins AS T1    INNER JOIN historical AS T2 ON T1.id = T2.coin_id    WHERE STRFTIME('%Y-%m', T2.date) = '2013-05' AND T2.open IS NULL;      By following these steps, we can logically arrive at the solution to the problem, ensuring that we correctly identify the coins that were not opened in May 2013.",,

This means we need to focus on the `close` column in the `historical` table.    - We also need to know which entries in the `historical` table correspond to CHNCoin. This can be determined by matching the `coin_id` in the `historical` table with the `id` in the `coins` table where `name` is 'CHNCoin'.  3. **Plan the SQL Query**:    - We need to join the `coins` and `historical` tables to link the coin names with their historical data. This can be done using an INNER JOIN on `coins.id` and `historical.coin_id`.    - Filter the results to only include rows where the `name` in the `coins` table is 'CHNCoin'.  4. **Order and Limit the Results**:    - To find the highest closed price, order the results by the `close` column in descending order.    - Use `LIMIT 1` to get only the top result, which will be the highest closed price.  5. **Select the Desired Output**:    - We are interested in the date when the highest closed price occurred, so select the `date` column from the `historical` table.  6. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Combine all the steps into a coherent SQL query:            SELECT T2.date       FROM coins AS T1       INNER JOIN historical AS T2 ON T1.id = T2.coin_id       WHERE T1.name = 'CHNCoin'       ORDER BY T2.close DESC       LIMIT 1;        By following these steps, we ensure that we accurately retrieve the date of the highest closed price for CHNCoin from the given database schema.",,

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: We need to find the date when Peercoin was ranked fifth. This involves identifying the correct date from the historical data where Peercoin's rank was exactly five.  2. **Examine the Schema**: We have two tables: `coins` and `historical`. The `coins` table contains information about different cryptocurrencies, including Peercoin. The `historical` table contains historical data about these cryptocurrencies, including their ranks on different dates.  3. **Identify Relevant Columns**:    - From the `coins` table, the relevant columns are `id` and `name`. The `id` will help us link to the `historical` table, and `name` will help us filter for Peercoin.    - From the `historical` table, the relevant columns are `date`, `coin_id`, and `cmc_rank`. The `coin_id` will link back to the `coins` table, `cmc_rank` will help us find when Peercoin ranked fifth, and `date` will provide the date of that rank.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - **Join the Tables**: We need to join the `coins` and `historical` tables on the `id` from `coins` and `coin_id` from `historical` to connect the data about Peercoin with its historical rank data.    - **Filter for Peercoin**: Use a `WHERE` clause to filter the results to only include data for Peercoin. This can be done by checking `T1.name = 'Peercoin'`.    - **Filter for Rank**: Further filter the results to find when Peercoin's `cmc_rank` was 5. This can be done by adding `T2.cmc_rank = 5` to the `WHERE` clause.    - **Select the Date**: Finally, select the `date` column from the `historical` table to get the specific date when Peercoin was ranked fifth.  5. **Write the SQL Query**: Based on the above steps, the SQL query is constructed as follows:        SELECT T2.date     FROM coins AS T1     INNER JOIN historical AS T2     ON T1.id = T2.coin_id     WHERE T1.name = 'Peercoin'     AND T2.cmc_rank = 5;      6. **Verify the Query**: Ensure that the query correctly joins the tables, filters for Peercoin, checks for the correct rank, and selects the appropriate date.  By following these logical steps, we can systematically arrive at the solution to determine when Peercoin ranked fifth.",,

Here’s a breakdown of the reasoning process:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to find out when Devcoin was most valuable in the market.

Therefore, we should filter the `coins` table to find the row where the `name` is 'Devcoin'.  5. **Join Tables to Access Historical Data**:    - Use an INNER JOIN to combine the `coins` and `historical` tables based on the matching `id` and `coin_id`. This will allow us to access historical market data for Devcoin.  6. **Identify the Metric for ""Most Valuable""**:    - The problem implies that ""most valuable"" is determined by the market capitalization. Thus, we need to look at the `market_cap` column in the `historical` table.  7. **Order the Data to Find the Peak Value**:    - To find when Devcoin was most valuable, sort the joined data by `market_cap` in descending order. This will bring the highest market capitalization to the top.  8. **Select the Relevant Date**:    - Once sorted, the date corresponding to the highest market capitalization will be the first row. Select this date.  9. **Limit the Result**:    - Since we only need the date of the highest market capitalization, limit the result to one row.  10. **Formulate the SQL Query**:     - Based on the above steps, the SQL query is:              SELECT T2.date        FROM coins AS T1        INNER JOIN historical AS T2        ON T1.id = T2.coin_id        WHERE T1.name = 'Devcoin'        ORDER BY T2.market_cap DESC        LIMIT 1;         By following these logical steps, we can systematically arrive at the solution to determine when Devcoin was most valuable in the market.",,

This can be done using a `WHERE` clause on the `date` column.  5. **Select the Top Five Coins**:    - We are interested in the top five coins by rank on the specified date. Therefore, we need to filter the results where `cmc_rank` is less than or equal to 5.  6. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Using the above steps, we can construct the SQL query:            SELECT T1.name      FROM coins AS T1      INNER JOIN historical AS T2 ON T1.id = T2.coin_id      WHERE T2.date = '2014-01-01' AND T2.cmc_rank <= 5        7. **Verify the Solution**:    - Ensure that the query correctly joins the tables, filters by the correct date, and selects only the top five coins by rank.  By following these logical steps, we can systematically arrive at the solution to the problem.",,

This is done by checking `T1.name = 'Lebowskis'`.  6. **Check the Open Status**:    - We need to find dates where the `open` value is either NULL or zero, indicating that the coin was not opened on those dates. This is done by adding a condition `(T2.open IS NULL OR T2.open = 0)`.  7. **Select Distinct Dates**:    - Since we are interested in the dates when the coin was not opened, we select distinct dates from the filtered results to avoid duplicates.  8. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Combine all the above steps into a coherent SQL query:            SELECT DISTINCT T2.date       FROM coins AS T1       INNER JOIN historical AS T2 ON T1.id = T2.coin_id       WHERE T1.name = 'Lebowskis' AND (T2.open IS NULL OR T2.open = 0);        By following these logical steps, we can derive the solution to the problem, ensuring that we accurately identify the dates when Lebowskis was not opened.",,

This relationship allows us to join these tables to get historical data for a specific coin.  4. **Filter for Terracoin**:    - We need to focus on Terracoin, so we filter the `coins` table where the `name` column is 'Terracoin'.  5. **Join the Tables**:    - Use an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `coins` and `historical` tables on the matching `id` and `coin_id` columns. This will allow us to access historical price data specifically for Terracoin.  6. **Sort by Price**:    - Once we have the joined data, sort the results by the `price` column in descending order. This will bring the highest price to the top of the result set.  7. **Select the Date of the Highest Price**:    - After sorting, the first row will contain the highest price. Use `LIMIT 1` to select only this top row, and retrieve the `date` column to find out when this highest price occurred.  8. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Combining all these steps, the SQL query is formulated as:            SELECT T2.date       FROM coins AS T1       INNER JOIN historical AS T2       ON T1.id = T2.coin_id       WHERE T1.name = 'Terracoin'       ORDER BY T2.price DESC       LIMIT 1;        By following these steps, we can logically deduce the date when Terracoin reached its highest price using the provided schema and data.",,

We will use this relationship to join the tables.  4. **Filter for Bytecoin**:    - We need to filter the results to only include entries where the `name` in the `coins` table is 'Bytecoin'.  5. **Filter for June 2013**:    - We need to extract the year and month from the `date` column in the `historical` table and filter for entries where this value is '2013-06'.  6. **Count the Number of Trades**:    - After filtering the relevant records, we need to count the number of entries in the `historical` table that match the criteria.  7. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Using the above logic, we can construct the SQL query:            SELECT COUNT(T2.coin_id)      FROM coins AS T1      INNER JOIN historical AS T2 ON T1.id = T2.coin_id      WHERE T1.name = 'Bytecoin'      AND STRFTIME('%Y-%m', T2.date) = '2013-06'        8. **Verify and Execute**:    - Verify that the query correctly joins the tables, applies the necessary filters, and counts the trades.    - Execute the query to obtain the result.

Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the logical reasoning that could lead to the solution:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to find out which coins had a price increase compared to their price one hour ago on May 29, 2013.    - We are required to list the names of these coins.  2. **Examine the Schema**:    - We have two tables: `coins` and `historical`.    - The `coins` table contains information about each coin, including its `id` and `name`.    - The `historical` table contains historical data for each coin, including `date`, `coin_id`, and `percent_change_1h`.  3. **Identify Relevant Columns**:    - From the `coins` table, we need the `name` of the coins.    - From the `historical` table, we need the `date`, `coin_id`, and `percent_change_1h` to determine if the price increased.  4. **Formulate the Query Logic**:    - We need to join the `coins` and `historical` tables to associate each coin with its historical data. This can be done using the `coin_id` from the `historical` table and the `id` from the `coins` table.    - We need to filter the records to only include those from May 29, 2013. This can be done by setting a condition on the `date` column in the `historical` table.    - We need to find coins where the `percent_change_1h` is greater than 0, indicating that the price increased compared to one hour ago.  5. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Use an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `coins` and `historical` tables based on the matching `id` and `coin_id`.    - Apply a `WHERE` clause to filter for records with `date = '2013-05-29'` and `percent_change_1h > 0`.    - Select the `name` of the coins that meet these conditions.  6. **Write the SQL Query**:    - The final SQL query is:            SELECT T1.NAME       FROM coins AS T1       INNER JOIN historical AS T2       ON T1.ID = T2.coin_id       WHERE T2.DATE = '2013-05-29'       AND T2.percent_change_1h > 0;        7. **Calculate the Percentage (if needed)**:    - If the problem requires calculating the percentage of coins with a price increase, additional steps would involve counting the total number of coins and the number of coins with a price increase, then calculating the percentage. However, the provided solution only lists the names of the coins.  By following these logical steps, we can arrive at the solution to the problem, ensuring that we correctly identify and list the coins with a price increase on the specified date.",,

Here is a detailed breakdown of the thought process:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to find out how many employees have a doctorate degree. This implies we are looking for employees with a specific educational qualification.  2. **Review the Schema**:    - Examine the provided schema to identify which table contains information about employees and their qualifications.    - The relevant table here is `Employees`.  3. **Identify Relevant Columns**:    - Look for columns in the `Employees` table that might indicate educational qualifications.    - The `Notes` column contains detailed information about each employee, including their educational background.  4. **Analyze Sample Data**:    - Review the sample data provided for the `Notes` column to understand how educational qualifications are recorded.    - Notice that the sample data mentions specific degrees, such as ""Ph.D."" for Andrew.  5. **Formulate a Query Strategy**:    - Since the `Notes` column contains text data, we need to search for specific keywords that indicate a doctorate.    - The keyword ""Ph.D."" is a common abbreviation for a doctorate degree.  6. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Use a `SELECT` statement to count the number of employees with a doctorate.    - Use the `WHERE` clause to filter employees whose `Notes` contain the keyword ""Ph.D."".  7. **Consider Alternative Indicators**:    - Besides ""Ph.D."", consider if there are other titles or keywords that could indicate a doctorate, such as ""Dr."" in the `TitleOfCourtesy` column.    - The `TitleOfCourtesy` column is a more straightforward indicator if it uses titles like ""Dr."" for employees with a doctorate.  8. **Refine the Query**:    - If the `TitleOfCourtesy` column uses ""Dr."" for employees with a doctorate, use this column for a simpler query.    - Construct the query: `SELECT COUNT(EmployeeID) FROM Employees WHERE TitleOfCourtesy = 'Dr.'`.  9. **Verify the Solution**:    - Ensure the query correctly counts the number of employees with a doctorate by checking against the sample data and understanding of the schema.  By following these steps, we can logically deduce that the solution involves counting employees with the title ""Dr."" in the `TitleOfCourtesy` column, as this is a clear and direct indicator of a doctorate.",,

This requires us to find the manager or supervisor of Nancy Davolio within the Employees table.  2. **Identify Relevant Table and Columns**: From the schema, we recognize that the Employees table contains information about employees, including their first and last names. However, the schema provided does not explicitly mention a ""ReportsTo"" column, which is typically used to indicate an employee's manager. Assuming this column exists, we will use it to find the manager.  3. **Locate Nancy Davolio's Record**: We need to find Nancy Davolio's record in the Employees table. This can be done by querying the table using her first and last name.  4. **Extract the Manager's ID**: Once we have located Nancy Davolio's record, we will extract the value from the ""ReportsTo"" column. This value represents the EmployeeID of Nancy's manager.  5. **Find the Manager's Details**: With the EmployeeID obtained from the ""ReportsTo"" column, we perform another query on the Employees table to retrieve the full name (FirstName and LastName) of the manager.  6. **Write the SQL Query**: Combine the above steps into a single SQL query. The query will first find Nancy Davolio's manager's EmployeeID and then use it to find the manager's full name.  Here's how the SQL query is structured:   SELECT FirstName, LastName  FROM Employees  WHERE EmployeeID = (     SELECT ReportsTo      FROM Employees      WHERE LastName = 'Davolio' AND FirstName = 'Nancy' );   - The subquery `(SELECT ReportsTo FROM Employees WHERE LastName = 'Davolio' AND FirstName = 'Nancy')` finds the EmployeeID of Nancy Davolio's manager. - The outer query `SELECT FirstName, LastName FROM Employees WHERE EmployeeID = ...` retrieves the full name of the manager using the EmployeeID obtained from the subquery.

This involves identifying Andrew Fuller in the database and then finding all employees who have him as their supervisor.  2. **Examine the Schema**: Review the schema provided to identify relevant tables and columns. The `Employees` table is of particular interest because it contains information about employees, including their supervisors.  3. **Identify Key Columns**: In the `Employees` table, look for columns that can help identify supervisors. Typically, there is a column like `ReportsTo` that indicates the supervisor of an employee. We also need columns to identify Andrew Fuller, such as `FirstName` and `LastName`.  4. **Find Andrew Fuller's EmployeeID**: Since supervisors are usually referenced by their `EmployeeID`, we need to find Andrew Fuller's `EmployeeID`. This can be done by querying the `Employees` table where `FirstName` is 'Andrew' and `LastName` is 'Fuller'.  5. **Query for Employees Reporting to Andrew Fuller**: Once we have Andrew Fuller's `EmployeeID`, we can query the `Employees` table again to find all employees whose `ReportsTo` column matches this `EmployeeID`.  6. **Count the Number of Employees**: Finally, count the number of employees who report to Andrew Fuller. This can be achieved by using the `COUNT` function in SQL.  7. **Formulate the SQL Query**: Combine the above steps into a single SQL query. Use a subquery to find Andrew Fuller's `EmployeeID` and then use this result in the main query to count the employees reporting to him.  Here is the SQL query that implements these steps:   SELECT COUNT(EmployeeID)  FROM Employees  WHERE ReportsTo = (     SELECT EmployeeID      FROM Employees      WHERE LastName = 'Fuller' AND FirstName = 'Andrew' );   This query effectively counts the number of employees who have Andrew Fuller as their direct supervisor by first identifying his `EmployeeID` and then using it to filter the `Employees` table.",,

Here's how you can approach the problem:  1. **Understand the Requirement**: The task is to find the employee responsible for sales in the territory of Hollis and return their full name. This means we need to identify the relevant tables and columns that can help us link employees to territories.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**: Based on the schema provided, we need to determine which tables contain information about employees and territories. The `Employees` table contains employee details, and we need to find a table that links employees to territories.  3. **Look for Linking Tables**: The schema does not explicitly mention a table named `EmployeeTerritories`, but the solution suggests its existence. This table likely links employees to territories through `EmployeeID` and `TerritoryID`.  4. **Identify Territory Information**: We need to find a table that contains territory descriptions. The solution references a table named `Territories`, which likely contains territory details, including descriptions.  5. **Formulate the Query**:    - **Join Tables**: We need to join the `Employees`, `EmployeeTerritories`, and `Territories` tables. The `Employees` table should be joined with `EmployeeTerritories` on `EmployeeID`, and `EmployeeTerritories` should be joined with `Territories` on `TerritoryID`.    - **Filter by Territory**: Use a `WHERE` clause to filter the results by the `TerritoryDescription` column to find the territory named 'Hollis'.    - **Select Required Columns**: Once the correct employee is identified, select their `FirstName` and `LastName` from the `Employees` table to get the full name.  6. **Write the SQL Query**: Based on the above steps, the SQL query is constructed as follows:        SELECT T1.FirstName, T1.LastName    FROM Employees AS T1    INNER JOIN EmployeeTerritories AS T2 ON T1.EmployeeID = T2.EmployeeID    INNER JOIN Territories AS T3 ON T2.TerritoryID = T3.TerritoryID    WHERE T3.TerritoryDescription = 'Hollis';      7. **Verify the Solution**: Ensure that the query correctly retrieves the employee's full name responsible for the Hollis territory by checking the logic and the joins used.  By following these logical steps, we can systematically approach the problem and derive the solution effectively.",,

Here's how we can break down the process:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: We need to find territories managed by Nancy Davolio. This implies a relationship between employees and territories.  2. **Analyze the Schema**: Review the schema to identify relevant tables and columns. We notice:    - The `Employees` table contains employee details, including names.    - We need to find a connection between employees and territories, which is likely through a relationship table.  3. **Identify Relevant Tables**:    - **Employees**: To find Nancy Davolio's EmployeeID.    - **EmployeeTerritories**: This table is likely to map employees to territories.    - **Territories**: To get the descriptions of the territories.  4. **Determine the Relationships**:    - The `Employees` table can be joined with the `EmployeeTerritories` table using `EmployeeID`.    - The `EmployeeTerritories` table can be joined with the `Territories` table using `TerritoryID`.  5. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Start by selecting the `TerritoryDescription` from the `Territories` table.    - Join `Employees` with `EmployeeTerritories` on `EmployeeID` to find the territories associated with Nancy Davolio.    - Join `EmployeeTerritories` with `Territories` on `TerritoryID` to get the territory descriptions.    - Filter the results by specifying Nancy Davolio's name in the `WHERE` clause.  6. **Write the SQL Query**:        SELECT T3.TerritoryDescription     FROM Employees AS T1     INNER JOIN EmployeeTerritories AS T2 ON T1.EmployeeID = T2.EmployeeID     INNER JOIN Territories AS T3 ON T2.TerritoryID = T3.TerritoryID     WHERE T1.FirstName = 'Nancy' AND T1.LastName = 'Davolio';      7. **Verify the Solution**:    - Ensure that the query correctly joins the tables and filters the results to only include territories managed by Nancy Davolio.    - Check that the columns and table aliases are correctly used.  By following these steps, we logically arrive at the solution to the problem, ensuring that all necessary relationships and conditions are considered.",,

Here's how we can approach the problem:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: We need to find out how many territories are managed by employees who are based in London. This requires us to identify employees in London and then determine the territories they are responsible for.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - **Employees Table**: This table contains information about employees, including their location. We need the `EmployeeID` and `City` columns to identify employees based in London.    - **EmployeeTerritories Table**: This table (not explicitly mentioned in the schema but inferred from the solution) likely contains mappings between employees and the territories they manage. We need the `EmployeeID` and `TerritoryID` columns from this table.  3. **Determine Necessary Joins**:    - We need to join the `Employees` table with the `EmployeeTerritories` table to link employees with their respective territories.    - The join condition will be based on the `EmployeeID` column, which is common to both tables.  4. **Filter for London Employees**:    - After joining the tables, we need to filter the results to include only employees who are based in London. This can be done by adding a `WHERE` clause that checks for `City = 'London'` in the `Employees` table.  5. **Count the Unique Territories**:    - Once we have the filtered list of territories managed by London-based employees, we need to count the distinct `TerritoryID` values to determine how many unique territories are managed by these employees.  6. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Based on the above steps, the SQL query would look like this:            SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT T2.TerritoryID)      FROM Employees AS T1      INNER JOIN EmployeeTerritories AS T2 ON T1.EmployeeID = T2.EmployeeID      WHERE T1.City = 'London';        7. **Verify the Solution**:    - Ensure that the query accurately reflects the problem requirements and that all necessary tables and columns are correctly referenced.    - Check that the logic for counting distinct territories is correctly implemented.

Here's how you might approach this problem:  1. **Understand the Schema and Problem Requirements**:     - We need to find employees based in the UK.    - We need to count how many of these employees are responsible for more than four territories.    - The relevant tables are likely `Employees` and `EmployeeTerritories`.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - The `Employees` table contains information about employees, including their `EmployeeID` and `Country`.    - The `EmployeeTerritories` table (though not explicitly listed in the schema, it's implied by the solution) likely contains `EmployeeID` and `TerritoryID`, linking employees to territories.  3. **Filter Employees by Country**:    - We need to filter employees to only those based in the UK. This can be done using a `WHERE` clause on the `Country` column in the `Employees` table.  4. **Join Tables to Associate Employees with Territories**:    - To find out which territories each employee is responsible for, join the `Employees` table with the `EmployeeTerritories` table on `EmployeeID`.  5. **Group by Employee to Count Territories**:    - Use `GROUP BY` on `EmployeeID` to aggregate data by employee.    - Use `COUNT` on `TerritoryID` to determine how many territories each employee is responsible for.  6. **Filter Employees with More Than Four Territories**:    - Use a `HAVING` clause to filter the grouped results to only include employees with a territory count greater than four.  7. **Count the Number of Employees Meeting the Criteria**:    - Use an outer query to count the number of employees who meet the criteria specified in the inner query.  8. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Combine all the steps into a coherent SQL query. The query should join the necessary tables, filter by country, group by employee, apply the `HAVING` clause, and finally count the results.  Here's how the SQL query would look based on these steps:   SELECT COUNT(COUNTEID)  FROM (     SELECT T1.EmployeeID AS COUNTEID      FROM Employees AS T1      INNER JOIN EmployeeTerritories AS T2 ON T1.EmployeeID = T2.EmployeeID      WHERE T1.Country = 'UK'      GROUP BY T1.EmployeeID      HAVING COUNT(T2.TerritoryID) > 4 ) T1   This query effectively counts the number of UK-based employees who manage more than four territories, following the logical steps outlined above.",,

This implies that there are tables related to territories and regions.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**: From the schema provided, we need to identify which tables contain information about territories and regions. Although the schema provided does not explicitly list tables for Territories or Regions, the solution references these tables. Assume that there are tables named `Territories` and `Region`.  3. **Determine Relationships**: Understand the relationship between territories and regions. Typically, a territory belongs to a region, which suggests a foreign key relationship between the `Territories` table and the `Region` table.  4. **Identify Key Columns**:    - In the `Territories` table, identify the column that links to the `Region` table, likely `RegionID`.    - In the `Region` table, identify the column that describes the region, likely `RegionDescription`.  5. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - **Join the Tables**: Use an INNER JOIN to combine the `Territories` table with the `Region` table based on the `RegionID`.    - **Filter by Region**: Use a WHERE clause to filter the results to only include territories in the ""Eastern"" region by checking the `RegionDescription` column.    - **Count the Territories**: Use the COUNT function on the `TerritoryID` column to get the number of territories in the specified region.  6. **Write the SQL Query**:    - The SQL query would look like this:            SELECT COUNT(T1.TerritoryID)      FROM Territories AS T1      INNER JOIN Region AS T2 ON T1.RegionID = T2.RegionID      WHERE T2.RegionDescription = 'Eastern'        7. **Verify the Solution**: Ensure that the query correctly counts the number of territories by checking the logic of the join and the filter condition.  By following these steps, you can logically derive the solution to count the number of territories in the Eastern Region using SQL.",,

These steps involve understanding the schema, identifying the relevant tables and columns, and constructing the SQL query to retrieve the desired information. Here's a breakdown of the thought process:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to list all territories that belong to the Eastern Region. This implies that we need to identify which tables contain information about territories and regions.  2. **Review the Schema**:    - Carefully examine the provided schema to identify tables that might contain information about territories and regions. However, the schema provided in the problem statement does not explicitly list tables for territories or regions. This suggests that there might be additional tables not listed in the schema.  3. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - Based on the solution provided, we infer that there are tables named `Territories` and `Region`. These tables likely contain columns such as `TerritoryDescription`, `RegionID`, and `RegionDescription`.    - The `Territories` table should have a `TerritoryDescription` column to describe the territory and a `RegionID` to link it to the `Region` table.    - The `Region` table should have a `RegionDescription` column to describe the region and a `RegionID` to uniquely identify each region.  4. **Determine the Relationship Between Tables**:    - The relationship between `Territories` and `Region` is established through the `RegionID` column, which is common to both tables. This allows us to join these tables to get information about which territories belong to which regions.  5. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Use an `INNER JOIN` to combine data from the `Territories` and `Region` tables based on the `RegionID`.    - Use a `WHERE` clause to filter the results to only include territories in the 'Eastern' region by checking the `RegionDescription` column.    - Use `SELECT DISTINCT` to ensure that each territory is only listed once, even if there are duplicate entries.  6. **Write the SQL Query**:    - The final SQL query is:            SELECT DISTINCT T1.TerritoryDescription       FROM Territories AS T1       INNER JOIN Region AS T2       ON T1.RegionID = T2.RegionID       WHERE T2.RegionDescription = 'Eastern';        7. **Verify and Test the Query**:    - Ensure that the query is syntactically correct and logically retrieves the correct data by testing it against the database.  By following these steps, we can logically deduce how to construct the SQL query to solve the problem of listing all territories in the Eastern Region.",,

Here’s a breakdown of the thought process:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: We need to find the number of employees responsible for sales in the Eastern Region. This implies that we need to identify employees associated with a specific region.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**: Based on the schema, we need to identify which tables might contain information about regions and employees. The tables likely involved are:    - `Region`: This table should contain information about different regions, including the Eastern Region.    - `Territories`: This table might link regions to specific territories.    - `EmployeeTerritories`: This table likely connects employees to the territories they are responsible for.  3. **Determine the Relationships**:    - The `Region` table should have a primary key (e.g., `RegionID`) that links to the `Territories` table.    - The `Territories` table should have a primary key (e.g., `TerritoryID`) that links to the `EmployeeTerritories` table.    - The `EmployeeTerritories` table should have a foreign key (e.g., `EmployeeID`) linking to the `Employees` table.  4. **Formulate the Query**:    - Start by selecting the `RegionID` from the `Region` table where the `RegionDescription` is 'Eastern'.    - Join the `Region` table with the `Territories` table using the `RegionID`.    - Join the resulting table with the `EmployeeTerritories` table using the `TerritoryID`.    - Select distinct `EmployeeID` values from the `EmployeeTerritories` table to ensure each employee is counted only once.    - Use a subquery to encapsulate the selection of distinct `EmployeeID`s.  5. **Count the Employees**:    - Use the `COUNT()` function on the result of the subquery to get the total number of unique employees responsible for the Eastern Region.  6. **Write the SQL Query**:    - The final query is structured to first select distinct `EmployeeID`s associated with the Eastern Region and then count these distinct IDs.  Here is the SQL query that implements these steps:   SELECT COUNT(T.EmployeeID)  FROM (     SELECT T3.EmployeeID      FROM Region AS T1      INNER JOIN Territories AS T2 ON T1.RegionID = T2.RegionID      INNER JOIN EmployeeTerritories AS T3 ON T2.TerritoryID = T3.TerritoryID      WHERE T1.RegionDescription = 'Eastern'      GROUP BY T3.EmployeeID ) T   This query effectively counts the number of unique employees who are in charge of sales in the Eastern Region by leveraging the relationships between the `Region`, `Territories`, and `EmployeeTerritories` tables.",,

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how to approach the problem:  1. **Understand the Schema and Relationships**:    - We need to identify the tables and their relationships that are relevant to the problem.    - The `Employees` table contains employee details, including their phone numbers.    - The `EmployeeTerritories` table likely links employees to the territories they manage.    - The `Territories` table contains information about different territories, including a `RegionID`.    - The `Region` table contains region descriptions, which will help us filter for the ""Eastern"" region.  2. **Identify the Required Columns**:    - We need the `HomePhone` column from the `Employees` table.    - We need to filter employees based on their association with territories in the ""Eastern"" region.  3. **Determine the Necessary Joins**:    - To connect employees to their territories, join the `Employees` table with the `EmployeeTerritories` table using `EmployeeID`.    - To connect territories to regions, join the `EmployeeTerritories` table with the `Territories` table using `TerritoryID`.    - To filter territories by region, join the `Territories` table with the `Region` table using `RegionID`.  4. **Apply the Filter for the Eastern Region**:    - Use a `WHERE` clause to filter the results to only include territories in the ""Eastern"" region. This is done by checking the `RegionDescription` column in the `Region` table.  5. **Select and Group the Results**:    - Select the `HomePhone` column from the `Employees` table.    - Use `GROUP BY` to ensure that each phone number is listed only once, in case an employee is responsible for multiple territories within the Eastern Region.  6. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Combine all the above steps into a coherent SQL query:            SELECT T1.HomePhone      FROM Employees AS T1      INNER JOIN EmployeeTerritories AS T2 ON T1.EmployeeID = T2.EmployeeID      INNER JOIN Territories AS T3 ON T2.TerritoryID = T3.TerritoryID      INNER JOIN Region AS T4 ON T3.RegionID = T4.RegionID      WHERE T4.RegionDescription = 'Eastern'      GROUP BY T1.HomePhone        By following these logical steps, we ensure that we correctly extract the desired information from the database, adhering to the relationships and constraints defined in the schema.",,

Here's how we can approach the problem:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to find the difference in the number of territories between the Eastern and Southern regions.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - Based on the problem, we need information about territories and regions. Therefore, we should look for tables that contain this information.    - From the schema provided, it appears that there are tables named `Territories` and `Region`. However, these tables are not explicitly listed in the schema provided in the problem, but they are referenced in the solution. We assume they exist based on the solution.  3. **Determine the Relationship Between Tables**:    - Typically, a `Territories` table would have a `TerritoryID` and a `RegionID` to associate each territory with a specific region.    - A `Region` table would have a `RegionID` and a `RegionDescription` to describe each region.  4. **Formulate the Query to Count Territories**:    - We need to count the number of territories in each region (Eastern and Southern).    - This involves joining the `Territories` table with the `Region` table on the `RegionID` to filter territories by region description.  5. **Calculate the Difference**:    - Once we have the counts of territories for both regions, we need to calculate the difference between these two counts.  6. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Use subqueries to separately count the territories for the Eastern and Southern regions.    - Subtract the count of Southern territories from the count of Eastern territories to get the desired result.  7. **Review the Solution**:    - The solution provided uses two subqueries to count the territories for each region and then subtracts the Southern count from the Eastern count.  Here is the breakdown of the SQL solution:   SELECT      (SELECT COUNT(T1.TerritoryID)       FROM Territories AS T1       INNER JOIN Region AS T2 ON T1.RegionID = T2.RegionID       WHERE T2.RegionDescription = 'Eastern')      -      (SELECT COUNT(T1.TerritoryID)       FROM Territories AS T1       INNER JOIN Region AS T2 ON T1.RegionID = T2.RegionID       WHERE T2.RegionDescription = 'Southern') AS Calu   - **Subquery 1**: Counts the number of territories in the Eastern region. - **Subquery 2**: Counts the number of territories in the Southern region. - **Subtraction**: The main query subtracts the Southern count from the Eastern count to get the difference, which is the final result labeled as `Calu`.",,

The relevant tables are:      - `Orders`: Contains `OrderID` which identifies each order.      - `OrderDetails`: Contains `OrderID` and `ProductID`, linking orders to products.      - `Products`: Contains `ProductID` and `ProductName`, providing the names of products.  3. **Determine the Relationships**:    - `OrderDetails` acts as a junction table between `Orders` and `Products`:      - `OrderDetails.OrderID` links to `Orders.OrderID`.      - `OrderDetails.ProductID` links to `Products.ProductID`.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - We need to retrieve product names from the `Products` table for a specific `OrderID` in the `OrderDetails` table.  5. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Use an `INNER JOIN` to connect `Products` and `OrderDetails` on `ProductID`:            SELECT T1.ProductName       FROM Products AS T1       INNER JOIN `Order Details` AS T2       ON T1.ProductID = T2.ProductID          - Add a `WHERE` clause to filter for `OrderID = 10248`:            WHERE T2.OrderID = 10248        6. **Review and Execute the Query**:    - Ensure the query logic aligns with the problem statement.    - Execute the query to obtain the list of product names for order no. 10248.

We have tables like Products, Orders, and OrderDetails that are relevant to our query.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**:    - **Products**: This table contains product information, including the ProductID and ProductName, which will help us identify ""Ikura"".    - **OrderDetails**: This table contains details of each order, including OrderID, ProductID, and Quantity. This is where we can find the quantity of each product ordered.  3. **Determine Relationships**:    - The **Products** table is related to the **OrderDetails** table through the ProductID. This relationship allows us to link product names to their respective order details.  4. **Formulate the Query**:    - We need to find the quantity of ""Ikura"" ordered in a specific order (OrderID = 10273). This involves filtering the OrderDetails table by OrderID and joining it with the Products table to filter by ProductName.  5. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - **Join** the Products table with the OrderDetails table on ProductID to access both product names and order quantities.    - **Filter** the results where the OrderID is 10273 and the ProductName is ""Ikura"".    - **Select** the Quantity from the resulting dataset.  6. **Write the SQL Code**:        SELECT T2.Quantity    FROM Products AS T1    INNER JOIN `Order Details` AS T2 ON T1.ProductID = T2.ProductID    WHERE T2.OrderID = 10273 AND T1.ProductName = 'Ikura';      7. **Verify the Solution**:    - Ensure the query correctly joins the tables and applies the necessary filters.    - Check if the query returns the expected result, which is the quantity of ""Ikura"" for order number 10273.

Here's how you can approach the problem:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to identify the product that is ordered in the highest quantity for a specific order (order no. 10248).    - Once identified, we need to calculate the total production of that product, which is the sum of units in stock and units on order.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - From the schema, the `OrderDetails` table contains information about each order, including `OrderID`, `ProductID`, and `Quantity`.    - The `Products` table contains details about each product, including `ProductID`, `UnitsInStock`, and `UnitsOnOrder`.  3. **Determine the Relationship Between Tables**:    - The `OrderDetails` table can be joined with the `Products` table using the `ProductID` column, which is common to both tables.  4. **Filter for the Specific Order**:    - We need to filter the `OrderDetails` table to only include rows where `OrderID` is 10248.  5. **Identify the Product with the Highest Quantity**:    - Once filtered, we need to sort the results by `Quantity` in descending order to identify the product with the highest quantity ordered.  6. **Retrieve Total Production for the Identified Product**:    - After identifying the product with the highest quantity, we need to retrieve the `UnitsInStock` and `UnitsOnOrder` for that product from the `Products` table.    - Calculate the total production as the sum of `UnitsInStock` and `UnitsOnOrder`.  7. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Use an `INNER JOIN` to combine `OrderDetails` and `Products` tables on `ProductID`.    - Apply a `WHERE` clause to filter for `OrderID` 10248.    - Use `ORDER BY Quantity DESC` to sort the products by quantity in descending order.    - Use `LIMIT 1` to select only the product with the highest quantity.    - Finally, select the sum of `UnitsInStock` and `UnitsOnOrder` for the identified product.  By following these logical steps, you can construct the SQL query that solves the problem:   SELECT T1.UnitsInStock + T1.UnitsOnOrder  FROM Products AS T1  INNER JOIN OrderDetails AS T2 ON T1.ProductID = T2.ProductID  WHERE T2.OrderID = 10248  ORDER BY T2.Quantity DESC  LIMIT 1;   This query will return the total production of the product ordered in the highest quantity for order no. 10248.",,

In database terms, this typically means products that are marked as ""discontinued.""  2. **Analyze the Schema**:    - Review the schema to identify relevant tables and columns. The key tables are `Products` and `OrderDetails`.    - The `Products` table contains a column `Discontinued` which likely indicates whether a product's production is continuous or not.    - The `OrderDetails` table links orders to products through `OrderID` and `ProductID`.  3. **Identify Relevant Columns**:    - From the `Products` table, we need `ProductID` and `Discontinued`.    - From the `OrderDetails` table, we need `OrderID` and `ProductID`.  4. **Formulate the Query Logic**:    - We need to find orders that include discontinued products. This requires a join between `Products` and `OrderDetails` on `ProductID`.    - Filter the results to only include products where `Discontinued = 1`.  5. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Use an INNER JOIN to combine `Products` and `OrderDetails` based on `ProductID`.    - Apply a WHERE clause to filter for products that are discontinued (`Discontinued = 1`).  6. **Select the Required Output**:    - Select `OrderID` from the filtered results to get the list of orders containing discontinued products.  7. **Write the SQL Query**:    - The final SQL query is:            SELECT T2.OrderID       FROM Products AS T1       INNER JOIN `Order Details` AS T2       ON T1.ProductID = T2.ProductID       WHERE T1.Discontinued = 1;        8. **Verify and Test the Query**:    - Ensure the query logic aligns with the problem requirements.    - Test the query on the database to verify it returns the correct results.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logical reasoning to arrive at the solution:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to find orders that include the product ""Ikura"".    - For these orders, we need to check if the unit price in the order is lower than the standard unit price of ""Ikura"".  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - The `Products` table contains information about the products, including their names and standard unit prices.    - The `OrderDetails` table contains information about the orders, including the product IDs, quantities, and unit prices for each order.  3. **Determine Necessary Joins**:    - Since we need to compare the unit price in the `OrderDetails` table with the standard unit price in the `Products` table, we need to join these two tables.    - The common column between these tables is `ProductID`.  4. **Filter for the Specific Product**:    - We need to filter the results to only include rows where the `ProductName` is ""Ikura"". This can be done using a `WHERE` clause on the `Products` table.  5. **Compare Unit Prices**:    - After filtering for ""Ikura"", we need to compare the `UnitPrice` from the `OrderDetails` table with the `Price` from the `Products` table.    - We are interested in cases where the `OrderDetails.UnitPrice` is less than the `Products.Price`.  6. **Count the Number of Orders**:    - We need to count the number of orders that meet the above criteria. This can be achieved using the `COUNT` function on the `OrderID` from the `OrderDetails` table.  7. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Using the above logic, construct the SQL query:            SELECT COUNT(T2.OrderID)      FROM Products AS T1      INNER JOIN `Order Details` AS T2 ON T1.ProductID = T2.ProductID      WHERE T1.ProductName = 'Ikura' AND T2.UnitPrice < T1.Price        8. **Verify the Solution**:    - Ensure the query correctly joins the tables, applies the necessary filters, and accurately counts the orders as per the problem statement.  By following these logical steps, we can construct a query that accurately solves the problem by leveraging the relationships between the tables and applying the necessary conditions.",,

This requires identifying the relationship between products and their suppliers.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - **Products Table**: Contains `ProductID`, `ProductName`, and `SupplierID`. We need `ProductName` for the output and `SupplierID` to link with the suppliers.    - **Suppliers Table**: Contains `SupplierID`, `SupplierName`, and `Country`. We need `Country` to filter suppliers based in Japan and `SupplierID` to join with the Products table.  3. **Determine the Relationship**:    - The `Products` table has a foreign key `SupplierID` that relates to the primary key `SupplierID` in the `Suppliers` table. This relationship allows us to join these tables.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Use an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Products` and `Suppliers` tables based on the `SupplierID`.    - Filter the results to include only those suppliers whose `Country` is 'Japan'.  5. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Start by selecting the `ProductName` from the `Products` table.    - Perform an `INNER JOIN` with the `Suppliers` table on the `SupplierID`.    - Add a `WHERE` clause to filter suppliers located in Japan.  6. **Construct the Final Query**:        SELECT T1.ProductName    FROM Products AS T1    INNER JOIN Suppliers AS T2 ON T1.SupplierID = T2.SupplierID    WHERE T2.Country = 'Japan';      7. **Verify the Solution**:    - Ensure the query correctly joins the tables and filters based on the specified condition.    - Check that the output is as expected, listing only the product names supplied by Japanese suppliers.  By following these steps, we systematically break down the problem, identify the necessary components, and construct a query to achieve the desired result.",,

This involves working with the `Products` and `Suppliers` tables.  2. **Examine the Schema**:     - The `Products` table contains information about products, including `ProductID`, `ProductName`, `SupplierID`, and `Price`.    - The `Suppliers` table contains information about suppliers, including `SupplierID` and `SupplierName`.  3. **Identify Relevant Columns**:     - From the `Products` table, we need the `Price` column to determine the highest unit price and the `SupplierID` to link to the supplier.    - From the `Suppliers` table, we need the `SupplierName` to identify the supplier.  4. **Determine the Highest Unit Price**:    - Use an aggregate function to find the maximum price from the `Products` table. This can be done using `MAX(Price)`.  5. **Find the Product with the Highest Price**:    - Use a subquery to select the maximum price from the `Products` table. This subquery will help us filter the product(s) that match this price.  6. **Join Tables to Get Supplier Information**:    - Use an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Products` and `Suppliers` tables on the `SupplierID` column. This will allow us to access the supplier's information for the product with the highest price.  7. **Filter for the Maximum Price**:    - In the `WHERE` clause, compare the `Price` of products to the maximum price obtained from the subquery. This ensures we only select the product(s) with the highest price.  8. **Select the Supplier Name**:    - Finally, select the `SupplierName` from the `Suppliers` table for the product with the highest price.  By following these steps, we can construct the SQL query that accurately identifies the supplier of the product with the highest unit price. The complete SQL query is:   SELECT T2.SupplierName  FROM Products AS T1  INNER JOIN Suppliers AS T2 ON T1.SupplierID = T2.SupplierID  WHERE T1.Price = (SELECT MAX(Price) FROM Products);   This query effectively uses a subquery to find the maximum price and joins the necessary tables to retrieve the supplier's name.",,

These steps involve understanding the schema, identifying the relevant tables and columns, and constructing an SQL query that meets the problem's requirements. Here's how you can approach this problem:  1. **Understand the Schema**:     - Review the schema to identify tables and columns that are relevant to the problem. The key tables are likely `Employees` and a table that links employees to territories. However, the schema provided does not explicitly list an `EmployeeTerritories` table, which is crucial for solving this problem. We will assume such a table exists based on common database structures.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - **Employees Table**: This table contains employee information, including `EmployeeID` and `Salary`.    - **EmployeeTerritories Table**: This assumed table would link employees to territories, containing `EmployeeID` and `TerritoryID`.  3. **Determine the Relationships**:    - The relationship between employees and territories is many-to-many, typically managed by a linking table (`EmployeeTerritories`).  4. **Formulate the Query**:    - **Join the Tables**: Use an INNER JOIN to combine the `Employees` table with the `EmployeeTerritories` table on `EmployeeID`. This will allow us to associate each employee with their respective territories.    - **Group by Employee**: Use the `GROUP BY` clause on `EmployeeID` to aggregate data for each employee.    - **Count Territories**: Use the `COUNT` function to count the number of territories each employee is responsible for.    - **Filter Employees**: Use the `HAVING` clause to filter out employees who manage sales in more than four territories (`COUNT(TerritoryID) > 4`).    - **Calculate Average Salary**: Use the `AVG` function to calculate the average salary of the filtered employees.  5. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - The SQL query is constructed as follows:            SELECT AVG(T1.Salary)      FROM Employees AS T1      INNER JOIN EmployeeTerritories AS T2 ON T1.EmployeeID = T2.EmployeeID      GROUP BY T1.EmployeeID      HAVING COUNT(T2.TerritoryID) > 4;        6. **Verify the Solution**:    - Ensure that the query correctly calculates the average salary for employees who manage more than four territories by testing it against the database.  By following these steps, you can logically derive the solution to the problem using the given schema and the assumed existence of an `EmployeeTerritories` table.",,

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logical reasoning process to arrive at the solution:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement:**    - We need to find the product with the highest ratio of units on order to units in stock for a specific order (order no. 10248).  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns:**    - From the schema, the relevant tables are `Products` and `OrderDetails` (referred to as `Order Details` in the solution).    - The `Products` table contains `ProductID`, `ProductName`, `UnitsOnOrder`, and `UnitsInStock`.    - The `OrderDetails` table contains `OrderID`, `ProductID`, and `Quantity`.  3. **Determine the Required Data:**    - We need to focus on products that are part of order no. 10248. This information is stored in the `OrderDetails` table.    - We need to calculate the ratio of `UnitsOnOrder` to `UnitsInStock` for these products. This data is available in the `Products` table.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query:**    - Start by joining the `Products` table with the `OrderDetails` table to link product information with order details. The common column for joining is `ProductID`.    - Filter the results to only include records where `OrderID` is 10248.    - Calculate the ratio of `UnitsOnOrder` to `UnitsInStock` for each product.    - Order the results by this ratio in descending order to find the product with the highest ratio.    - Limit the results to the top entry to get the product with the largest ratio.  5. **Write the SQL Query:**    - Using the above logic, the SQL query can be constructed as follows:            SELECT T1.ProductName      FROM Products AS T1      INNER JOIN `Order Details` AS T2 ON T1.ProductID = T2.ProductID      WHERE T2.OrderID = 10248      ORDER BY T1.UnitsOnOrder / T1.UnitsInStock DESC      LIMIT 1;        6. **Verify the Solution:**    - Ensure that the query correctly joins the tables, filters the order, calculates the ratio, sorts the results, and limits the output to the desired product.  By following these logical steps, we can confidently arrive at the solution to the problem, ensuring that we correctly identify the product with the largest ratio of units on order to units in stock for order no. 10248.",,

Here’s how you might approach the problem:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - The task is to identify the newest hired employee and return their full name. This means we need to find the employee with the most recent hire date.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - From the schema, identify the table that contains employee information. In this case, it is the `Employees` table.    - Determine which columns are relevant for solving the problem. We need `FirstName`, `LastName`, and a column that indicates the hire date. Although the schema provided does not explicitly list a `HireDate` column, we assume its presence based on the solution provided.  3. **Determine the Logic for Finding the Newest Employee**:    - To find the newest hired employee, we need to identify the maximum value in the `HireDate` column. This will give us the most recent hire date.  4. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Start by writing a subquery to find the maximum hire date from the `Employees` table: `SELECT MAX(HireDate) FROM Employees`.    - Use this subquery to filter the main query to select the employee(s) with this hire date.    - Construct the main query to select the `FirstName` and `LastName` of the employee(s) where the `HireDate` matches the maximum hire date found in the subquery.  5. **Combine the Queries**:    - Integrate the subquery within the main query to filter the results based on the maximum hire date.    - The final query will look like this:            SELECT FirstName, LastName       FROM Employees       WHERE HireDate = (SELECT MAX(HireDate) FROM Employees);        6. **Verify the Solution**:    - Ensure that the query correctly identifies and returns the newest hired employee(s). If there are multiple employees hired on the same most recent date, the query will return all of them.  7. **Consider Edge Cases**:    - Consider scenarios such as multiple employees hired on the same day, and ensure the query handles such cases correctly by returning all relevant employees.  By following these logical steps, you can systematically arrive at the solution for identifying the newest hired employee in the database.",,

This relationship allows us to link orders to the specific employee.  5. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Use an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Employees` and `Orders` tables based on the `EmployeeID`.    - Filter the results to only include rows where the `FirstName` is 'Michael' and the `LastName` is 'Suyama'.    - Count the number of `OrderID` entries that match these criteria to get the total number of orders handled by Michael Suyama.  6. **Write the SQL Query**:        SELECT COUNT(T2.OrderID)    FROM Employees AS T1    INNER JOIN Orders AS T2 ON T1.EmployeeID = T2.EmployeeID    WHERE T1.FirstName = 'Michael' AND T1.LastName = 'Suyama';      7. **Verify the Query**:    - Ensure the query correctly joins the tables and accurately filters for Michael Suyama.    - Check that the `COUNT` function is correctly applied to the `OrderID` to get the total number of orders.

Here's how we can approach the problem:  1. **Understand the Schema and Problem Context**:     - We are given a schema with several tables, including `Employees`, `EmployeeTerritories`, and `Territories`.    - The problem asks for the territory of Ms. Laura Callahan's direct supervisor. This implies we need to find Laura Callahan's supervisor and then determine the supervisor's territory.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - The `Employees` table contains information about employees, including their supervisors (via the `ReportsTo` column).    - The `EmployeeTerritories` table links employees to territories.    - The `Territories` table provides descriptions of territories.  3. **Locate Ms. Laura Callahan in the Employees Table**:    - We need to find the employee record for Ms. Laura Callahan. This can be done by filtering the `Employees` table where `TitleOfCourtesy` is 'Ms.', `FirstName` is 'Laura', and `LastName` is 'Callahan'.  4. **Determine Laura Callahan's Supervisor**:    - Once we have Laura Callahan's record, we can use the `ReportsTo` column to find her supervisor's `EmployeeID`.  5. **Find the Supervisor's Territories**:    - With the supervisor's `EmployeeID`, we can look into the `EmployeeTerritories` table to find all territories associated with this supervisor.    - The `EmployeeTerritories` table will provide `TerritoryID`s linked to the supervisor.  6. **Retrieve Territory Descriptions**:    - Using the `TerritoryID`s obtained in the previous step, we can join with the `Territories` table to get the `TerritoryDescription`.  7. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Use a subquery to find Laura Callahan's supervisor's `EmployeeID`.    - Join the `Employees` table with the `EmployeeTerritories` table to link employees with their territories.    - Further join with the `Territories` table to get the territory descriptions.    - Filter the result to only include the territories of Laura Callahan's supervisor.  8. **Write the SQL Solution**:    - The final SQL query should look like this:            SELECT T3.TerritoryDescription       FROM Employees AS T1       INNER JOIN EmployeeTerritories AS T2 ON T1.EmployeeID = T2.EmployeeID       INNER JOIN Territories AS T3 ON T2.TerritoryID = T3.TerritoryID       WHERE T1.EmployeeID = (          SELECT ReportsTo           FROM Employees           WHERE TitleOfCourtesy = 'Ms.'           AND FirstName = 'Laura'           AND LastName = 'Callahan'      );        By following these logical steps, we can systematically solve the problem and arrive at the correct SQL query to find the territory where Ms. Laura Callahan's direct supervisor works.",,

This implies that we need to connect employee information with territory information.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**:     - We need employee information, specifically the home phone number, which is likely found in the `Employees` table.    - We need to know which employee is in charge of the ""Savannah"" territory, which suggests a relationship between employees and territories.  3. **Explore Schema for Relationships**:    - Look for tables that could link employees to territories. Typically, this involves a many-to-many relationship, which is often represented by a junction table.    - Notice the absence of direct mention of territories in the provided schema. This suggests that there might be additional tables not listed, such as `EmployeeTerritories` and `Territories`.  4. **Hypothesize Missing Tables**:    - Assume the existence of an `EmployeeTerritories` table that links `EmployeeID` to `TerritoryID`.    - Assume the existence of a `Territories` table that includes `TerritoryID` and `TerritoryDescription`.  5. **Formulate the Query**:    - Start by selecting the `HomePhone` from the `Employees` table.    - Join the `Employees` table with the `EmployeeTerritories` table on `EmployeeID` to connect employees to their territories.    - Further join with the `Territories` table on `TerritoryID` to access territory descriptions.    - Apply a `WHERE` clause to filter for the `TerritoryDescription` equal to ""Savannah"".  6. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Use `INNER JOIN` to combine the tables based on the identified relationships.    - Ensure the `WHERE` clause accurately filters for the ""Savannah"" territory.  7. **Final SQL Query**:        SELECT T1.HomePhone     FROM Employees AS T1     INNER JOIN EmployeeTerritories AS T2 ON T1.EmployeeID = T2.EmployeeID     INNER JOIN Territories AS T3 ON T2.TerritoryID = T3.TerritoryID     WHERE T3.TerritoryDescription = 'Savannah';      By following these steps, we logically deduce the necessary joins and conditions to retrieve the desired information from the database.",,

These are the `Orders` and `OrderDetails` tables.    - The `Orders` table contains `OrderID`, `CustomerID`, and `OrderDate`.    - The `OrderDetails` table contains `OrderID` and `Quantity`.  3. **Determine the Relationships**:    - There is a relationship between the `Orders` and `OrderDetails` tables through the `OrderID` column. This relationship allows us to join these tables to get detailed information about each order.  4. **Filter the Orders**:    - We need to filter the orders to find the one placed by the customer ""HILAA"" on 1997/12/25. This requires filtering the `Orders` table by `CustomerID` and `OrderDate`.    - Assume that `CustomerID` for ""HILAA"" is known or can be determined from the `Customers` table if needed.  5. **Join the Tables**:    - Use an INNER JOIN to combine the `Orders` and `OrderDetails` tables based on the `OrderID`. This will allow us to access the quantities of products for the specific order.  6. **Calculate the Total Quantity**:    - Use the `SUM` function to calculate the total quantity of products in the order. This involves summing up the `Quantity` column from the `OrderDetails` table for the filtered order.  7. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Construct the SQL query using the identified steps:            SELECT SUM(T2.Quantity)       FROM Orders AS T1       INNER JOIN `OrderDetails` AS T2 ON T1.OrderID = T2.OrderID       WHERE T1.CustomerID = 'HILAA'       AND T1.OrderDate LIKE '1997-12-25%'          - Note: Ensure the correct table and column names are used, and adjust any identifiers as necessary based on the actual schema.  8. **Verify and Execute the Query**:    - Double-check the query for syntax errors and logical correctness.    - Execute the query in the SQL environment to obtain the desired result.  By following these steps, you can logically derive the solution to the problem and construct the appropriate SQL query.",,

Here are the logical steps that could have been taken to reach the solution:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to find the count of orders that were shipped using ""Federal Shipping"".  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**:    - From the schema, identify the tables that contain information about orders and shippers. The relevant tables are:      - `Orders`: Contains details about each order, including which shipper was used.      - `Shippers`: Contains details about each shipper, including the shipper's name.  3. **Determine the Relationship Between Tables**:    - The `Orders` table has a column `ShipperID` that corresponds to the `ShipperID` in the `Shippers` table. This relationship allows us to join these tables to get the shipper's name for each order.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - **Select the Data**: We need to count the number of orders, so we will use `COUNT(OrderID)`.    - **Join the Tables**: Use an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Orders` and `Shippers` tables based on the `ShipperID`.    - **Filter the Results**: Use a `WHERE` clause to filter the results to only include orders shipped by ""Federal Shipping"".  5. **Write the SQL Query**:    - The SQL query is constructed as follows:            SELECT COUNT(T1.OrderID)      FROM Orders AS T1      INNER JOIN Shippers AS T2 ON T1.ShipperID = T2.ShipperID      WHERE T2.ShipperName = 'Federal Shipping';          - This query counts the number of `OrderID`s from the `Orders` table (`T1`) where the `ShipperName` in the `Shippers` table (`T2`) is ""Federal Shipping"".  6. **Verify the Solution**:    - Ensure that the query correctly joins the tables and filters the orders by the specified shipper name.    - Check for any potential errors or edge cases, such as missing data or incorrect column names.

Here's how we can approach the problem:  1. **Understand the Schema**:     - We have multiple tables, but the relevant ones for this problem are `Categories` and `Products`.    - The `Categories` table contains information about different product categories, including a `CategoryID` and `CategoryName`.    - The `Products` table contains information about products, including `ProductID`, `ProductName`, and `CategoryID`.  2. **Identify the Relationship**:    - The `Products` table has a `CategoryID` column that links each product to a category in the `Categories` table. This relationship allows us to determine which products belong to the ""Dairy Products"" category.  3. **Determine the Target Category**:    - We are interested in products that belong to the ""Dairy Products"" category. We need to retrieve the `CategoryID` for ""Dairy Products"" from the `Categories` table.  4. **Formulate the Query**:    - We need to join the `Products` and `Categories` tables based on the `CategoryID` to filter products that belong to the ""Dairy Products"" category.    - Use an `INNER JOIN` to combine rows from both tables where the `CategoryID` matches.  5. **Count the Products**:    - After filtering the products that belong to the ""Dairy Products"" category, we need to count the distinct `ProductID`s to find out how many different products are in this category.  6. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Use the `SELECT` statement to count the products. The `INNER JOIN` will ensure that only products in the ""Dairy Products"" category are considered.    - The `WHERE` clause will filter the results to include only those products where the `CategoryName` is ""Dairy Products"".  Here is the SQL query that implements these steps:   SELECT COUNT(T1.ProductID)  FROM Products AS T1  INNER JOIN Categories AS T2  ON T1.CategoryID = T2.CategoryID  WHERE T2.CategoryName = 'Dairy Products';   - **Explanation of the Query**:   - `SELECT COUNT(T1.ProductID)`: This part of the query counts the number of distinct products.   - `FROM Products AS T1`: We are selecting from the `Products` table, aliased as `T1`.   - `INNER JOIN Categories AS T2 ON T1.CategoryID = T2.CategoryID`: This joins the `Products` table with the `Categories` table where their `CategoryID`s match.   - `WHERE T2.CategoryName = 'Dairy Products'`: This filters the results to include only those products that are in the ""Dairy Products"" category.   By following these steps, we can accurately determine the number of different products in the ""Dairy Products"" category.",,

Here’s how you can approach this problem:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to calculate the total production of products supplied by ""Escargots Nouveaux.""    - Total production can be interpreted as the sum of units in stock and units on order for each product from this supplier.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - From the schema, the relevant tables are `Products` and `Suppliers`.    - In the `Products` table, we are interested in the `SupplierID`, `UnitsInStock`, and `UnitsOnOrder`.    - In the `Suppliers` table, we need the `SupplierName` to identify ""Escargots Nouveaux.""  3. **Determine the Necessary Joins**:    - To link products with their suppliers, we need to perform an inner join between the `Products` and `Suppliers` tables on the `SupplierID` column.  4. **Filter for the Specific Supplier**:    - Use a `WHERE` clause to filter the results to include only those products supplied by ""Escargots Nouveaux.""  5. **Calculate the Total Production**:    - For each product from the specified supplier, calculate the total production as the sum of `UnitsInStock` and `UnitsOnOrder`.    - Use the `SUM` function to aggregate these values across all relevant products.  6. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Combine all the above steps into a coherent SQL query:            SELECT SUM(T1.UnitsInStock + T1.UnitsOnOrder)       FROM Products AS T1       INNER JOIN Suppliers AS T2       ON T1.SupplierID = T2.SupplierID       WHERE T2.SupplierName = 'Escargots Nouveaux';        7. **Verify the Solution**:    - Ensure that the query correctly joins the tables and filters the data to only include products from ""Escargots Nouveaux.""    - Check that the aggregation function is correctly summing the units in stock and on order.

The `Products` table contains information about products, including their names and associated supplier IDs. The `Suppliers` table contains information about suppliers, including their contact names.  3. **Determine the Relationship**: The `Products` table has a `SupplierID` column that links each product to a supplier in the `Suppliers` table. This relationship allows us to join these tables to access supplier information based on the product.  4. **Formulate the Join**: To get the supplier information for a specific product, we need to perform an INNER JOIN between the `Products` and `Suppliers` tables using the `SupplierID` column, which is common to both tables.  5. **Filter by Product Name**: Since we are interested in the product ""Gudbrandsdalsost"", we need to filter the results of our join operation to only include rows where the `ProductName` in the `Products` table matches ""Gudbrandsdalsost"".  6. **Select the Desired Output**: Once we have filtered the data to include only the relevant product, we can select the `ContactName` from the `Suppliers` table, which gives us the contact name of the supplier for ""Gudbrandsdalsost"".  7. **Write the SQL Query**: Based on the above steps, the SQL query can be constructed as follows:        SELECT T2.ContactName     FROM Products AS T1     INNER JOIN Suppliers AS T2     ON T1.SupplierID = T2.SupplierID     WHERE T1.ProductName = 'Gudbrandsdalsost';      8. **Verify the Solution**: Finally, ensure that the query accurately retrieves the correct contact name by cross-referencing with sample data or running the query in a database environment with the given schema.

Therefore, we should look for tables that contain this information.    - Based on the problem, the tables `Territories` and `Region` are likely candidates. These tables are not explicitly listed in the schema provided, but we can infer their existence from the solution.  3. **Determine the Relationship Between Tables**:    - Territories are likely linked to regions through a foreign key relationship. This means there should be a column in the `Territories` table that references a column in the `Region` table.    - The solution indicates that `Territories` has a `RegionID` column that links to the `RegionID` column in the `Region` table.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Start by selecting the `TerritoryID` from the `Territories` table, as we need to count these.    - Use an `INNER JOIN` to connect the `Territories` table with the `Region` table using the `RegionID` column.    - Apply a `WHERE` clause to filter the results for only those regions where the `RegionDescription` is ""Northern"".  5. **Count the Number of Territories**:    - Use the `COUNT` function to count the number of `TerritoryID` entries that meet the criteria specified in the `WHERE` clause.  6. **Write the SQL Query**:    - The final query is:             SELECT COUNT(T1.TerritoryID)       FROM Territories AS T1       INNER JOIN Region AS T2       ON T1.RegionID = T2.RegionID       WHERE T2.RegionDescription = 'Northern';        7. **Verify the Query**:    - Ensure that the query correctly counts the territories in the ""Northern"" region by checking the logic and the table relationships.

Here’s how you might approach the problem:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: The task is to find out which region ""Columbia"" belongs to. This implies that ""Columbia"" is likely a value in one of the tables, possibly related to geographic or territorial information.  2. **Review the Provided Schema**: Examine the schema to identify tables and columns that might contain geographic or territorial information. The tables provided are Categories, Customers, Employees, Shippers, Suppliers, Products, Orders, and OrderDetails.  3. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:     - None of the provided tables in the schema explicitly mention territories or regions. This suggests that there might be additional tables not listed in the schema, such as ""Territories"" and ""Region"", which are mentioned in the solution.    - Assume that these tables exist based on the solution provided.  4. **Hypothesize the Structure of Missing Tables**:    - **Territories Table**: This table likely contains a column named `TerritoryDescription` which includes the value ""Columbia"".    - **Region Table**: This table likely contains a column named `RegionDescription` which provides the region information we need.  5. **Determine the Relationship Between Tables**:    - The solution suggests that there is a relationship between the Territories and Region tables via a `RegionID` column.    - The `Territories` table likely contains a `RegionID` column that links to the `RegionID` column in the `Region` table.  6. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Use an INNER JOIN to combine the Territories and Region tables based on the `RegionID`.    - Filter the results to only include rows where the `TerritoryDescription` is ""Columbia"".  7. **Write the SQL Query**:    - The SQL query provided in the solution is:             SELECT T2.RegionDescription       FROM Territories AS T1       INNER JOIN Region AS T2       ON T1.RegionID = T2.RegionID       WHERE T1.TerritoryDescription = 'Columbia'          - This query selects the `RegionDescription` from the `Region` table for the territory described as ""Columbia"".  8. **Validate the Solution**:    - Ensure that the query logic aligns with the schema and problem statement.    - Confirm that the query correctly identifies the region associated with ""Columbia"" by joining the appropriate tables and filtering by the correct description.  By following these steps, you can logically deduce the solution to the problem, even if some tables are not explicitly listed in the initial schema.",,

Here is a step-by-step approach:  1. **Understand the Tables and Relationships**:    - Identify relevant tables: `Orders` and `Shippers`.    - The `Orders` table contains information about each order, including `CustomerID` and `ShipperID`.    - The `Shippers` table contains information about each shipper, including `ShipperID` and `ShipperName`.  2. **Identify the Customer of Interest**:    - We need to focus on orders placed by the customer with `CustomerID` ""WHITC"". This requires filtering the `Orders` table to only include rows where `CustomerID` is ""WHITC"".  3. **Determine the Shipper of Interest**:    - We are interested in orders fulfilled by ""United Package"". This requires filtering based on the `ShipperName` in the `Shippers` table.  4. **Join the Relevant Tables**:    - To associate each order with its shipper, perform an INNER JOIN between the `Orders` table and the `Shippers` table on the `ShipperID` field. This will allow us to access the `ShipperName` for each order.  5. **Count Total Orders for the Customer**:    - After filtering for the specific customer, count the total number of orders. This will be the denominator in our percentage calculation.  6. **Count Orders Fulfilled by ""United Package""**:    - Use a conditional count to determine how many of these orders were fulfilled by ""United Package"". This involves counting orders where the `ShipperName` is ""United Package"".  7. **Calculate the Percentage**:    - Calculate the percentage of orders fulfilled by ""United Package"" by dividing the count of such orders by the total number of orders for the customer and multiplying by 100.  8. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Combine all these steps into a single SQL query:            SELECT CAST(COUNT(CASE WHEN T2.ShipperName = 'United Package' THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(T1.OrderID)      FROM Orders AS T1      INNER JOIN Shippers AS T2 ON T1.ShipperID = T2.ShipperID      WHERE T1.CustomerID = 'WHITC'        9. **Verify the Logic**:    - Ensure that the query correctly filters and joins the tables, counts the orders accurately, and calculates the percentage as intended.  By following these steps, we ensure a systematic approach to solving the problem, leveraging SQL's ability to filter, join, and aggregate data effectively.",,

Here's a breakdown of how one might approach this problem:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to find the ratio of the number of territories in the ""Eastern Region"" to those in the ""Southern Region.""  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - From the schema, identify the tables that contain information about territories and regions. Based on the problem, the likely tables are `Territories` and `Region`.    - The `Territories` table should have a column for `TerritoryID` and `RegionID`.    - The `Region` table should have columns for `RegionID` and `RegionDescription`.  3. **Determine the Relationships**:    - Determine how these tables are related. Typically, `Territories` will have a foreign key `RegionID` that references the primary key `RegionID` in the `Region` table.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - We need to count the number of territories in each region (""Eastern"" and ""Southern""). This requires joining the `Territories` table with the `Region` table on `RegionID`.  5. **Write Subqueries for Each Region**:    - Create a subquery to count the number of territories in the ""Eastern Region"":            SELECT COUNT(T1.TerritoryID)      FROM Territories AS T1      INNER JOIN Region AS T2 ON T1.RegionID = T2.RegionID      WHERE T2.RegionDescription = 'Eastern'          - Similarly, create a subquery for the ""Southern Region"":            SELECT COUNT(T1.TerritoryID)      FROM Territories AS T1      INNER JOIN Region AS T2 ON T1.RegionID = T2.RegionID      WHERE T2.RegionDescription = 'Southern'        6. **Calculate the Ratio**:    - To find how many times the number of territories in the ""Eastern Region"" is compared to the ""Southern Region,"" divide the result of the first subquery by the second.    - Ensure the division result is a real number to account for any decimal values by casting the numerator to a real type.  7. **Combine the Queries**:    - Combine the subqueries into a single query to compute the desired ratio:            SELECT CAST(        (SELECT COUNT(T1.TerritoryID)         FROM Territories AS T1         INNER JOIN Region AS T2 ON T1.RegionID = T2.RegionID         WHERE T2.RegionDescription = 'Eastern') AS REAL) /        (SELECT COUNT(T1.TerritoryID)         FROM Territories AS T1         INNER JOIN Region AS T2 ON T1.RegionID = T2.RegionID         WHERE T2.RegionDescription = 'Southern') AS Calu        8. **Verify and Test**:    - Before finalizing, verify the query logic and test it with sample data to ensure it returns the correct ratio.  By following these steps, you can systematically approach the problem and construct a solution that accurately calculates the desired ratio of territories between the two specified regions.",,

This requires identifying the relevant columns that constitute a complete address.  2. **Review the Schema**: Examine the schema provided to identify which table contains customer information. In this case, the ""Customers"" table is relevant as it contains customer-related data.  3. **Identify Relevant Columns**: Determine which columns in the ""Customers"" table are needed to form a complete address. Typically, a complete address includes:    - Address    - City    - Region (if applicable)    - Country    - PostalCode  4. **Locate the Customer Name Column**: Identify the column that stores customer names. In the ""Customers"" table, this is the ""CustomerName"" column.  5. **Formulate the SQL Query**: Construct a SQL query to select the necessary address columns from the ""Customers"" table where the ""CustomerName"" matches ""Island Trading"". The query should look like this:        SELECT Address, City, Region, Country, PostalCode     FROM Customers     WHERE CustomerName = 'Island Trading';      6. **Verify the Solution**: Ensure that the query correctly selects the complete address information for the specified customer. Double-check that all relevant columns are included and that the condition accurately filters for ""Island Trading"".  7. **Consider Edge Cases**: Think about potential issues, such as multiple entries for ""Island Trading"" or missing data in any of the address fields. Ensure the query handles these scenarios appropriately.  8. **Execute the Query**: Run the query in the database to retrieve the desired information and verify the output matches expectations.  By following these steps, you can systematically approach and solve the problem of retrieving the complete address for the ""Island Trading"" customer.",,

This can be done using the `MAX()` function.    - Next, we use this maximum price to filter the product(s) that have this price.    - The SQL query can be structured as follows:            SELECT ProductName       FROM Products       WHERE Price = (SELECT MAX(Price) FROM Products);          - This query first calculates the maximum price using a subquery and then selects the product name(s) that match this price.  5. **Verify and Test the Query**:    - Ensure the query is syntactically correct and logically sound.    - Test the query on the database to confirm it returns the expected result, which is the name of the most expensive product.

Here are the logical steps that could have been taken:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - The task is to find the product with the highest user satisfaction. In the context of a database, user satisfaction might not be directly recorded, so we need to infer it from available data.  2. **Analyze the Schema**:    - Review the tables and columns available in the schema to identify where user satisfaction might be inferred.    - Notice that there is no direct column for user satisfaction in the provided schema.  3. **Identify Potential Indicators of User Satisfaction**:    - Consider what could indirectly indicate user satisfaction. Common indicators might include reorder levels, sales volume, or customer feedback.    - In this case, the solution uses the `ReorderLevel` from the `Products` table as a proxy for user satisfaction. A higher reorder level might imply higher demand, which could suggest higher satisfaction.  4. **Formulate the Query**:    - To find the product with the highest user satisfaction (inferred from reorder level), we need to find the product with the maximum reorder level.    - The query should select the `ProductName` from the `Products` table where the `ReorderLevel` is the maximum among all products.  5. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Use a subquery to find the maximum reorder level from the `Products` table.    - Use this maximum value to filter the products and select the `ProductName` that matches this reorder level.  6. **Review the Solution**:    - The provided solution is:             SELECT ProductName FROM Products WHERE ReorderLevel = (SELECT MAX(ReorderLevel) FROM Products)          - This query effectively selects the product(s) with the highest reorder level, which is used as a proxy for user satisfaction.  7. **Validate and Test the Query**:    - Ensure that the query runs correctly on the database and returns the expected results.    - Consider edge cases, such as multiple products having the same maximum reorder level.  By following these logical steps, we can understand how the solution was derived and why the `ReorderLevel` was chosen as an indicator of user satisfaction.",,

Here's how you might approach the problem:  1. **Understand the Schema**: Begin by examining the schema to identify which table contains the relevant information. In this case, the `Employees` table is the most relevant because it contains employee details.  2. **Identify Relevant Columns**: From the `Employees` table, determine which columns are necessary to solve the problem. You need the `FirstName`, `LastName`, and `Salary` columns. The `Salary` column is crucial for identifying the employee with the highest salary, while `FirstName` and `LastName` are needed to display the full name.  3. **Formulate the Query**: The goal is to find the employee with the maximum salary. This requires two steps:    - First, determine the maximum salary value from the `Employees` table.    - Second, retrieve the full name of the employee(s) who have this maximum salary.  4. **Use a Subquery for Maximum Salary**: To find the maximum salary, use a subquery. The subquery will calculate the maximum salary from the `Salary` column in the `Employees` table:        SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employees      5. **Select Employee with Maximum Salary**: Use the result of the subquery to filter the `Employees` table and select the employee(s) with this salary. This is done using a `WHERE` clause:        WHERE Salary = (SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employees)      6. **Select Full Name**: Finally, select the `FirstName` and `LastName` of the employee(s) identified in the previous step. This will give the full name of the employee(s) with the highest salary:        SELECT FirstName, LastName FROM Employees WHERE Salary = (SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employees)      7. **Consider Edge Cases**: Consider if there could be more than one employee with the same highest salary. The query as written will handle this by returning all employees who have the maximum salary.  By following these steps, you can logically arrive at the solution to find the full name of the employee with the highest salary using SQL.",,

The `ProductName` column will provide the names of the products. We also need a column that indicates whether a product is discontinued. Although not explicitly listed in the schema, the solution suggests the existence of a `Discontinued` column.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - **Select Clause**: We want to retrieve the product names, so we use `SELECT ProductName`.    - **From Clause**: The data is coming from the `Products` table, so we include `FROM Products`.    - **Where Clause**: We need to filter the products to only those that are discontinued. Assuming there is a `Discontinued` column that uses a binary indicator (e.g., 1 for discontinued, 0 for not discontinued), we add `WHERE Discontinued = 1`.  5. **Review and Validate**: Ensure that the query logically aligns with the problem statement and the schema. The query should correctly filter and return the names of discontinued products.

Here's how one might approach the problem:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to calculate the average salary of employees who are sales representatives and are located in the United Kingdom.  2. **Examine the Schema**:    - Identify which tables and columns are relevant to the problem. We are interested in employees, their titles, their salaries, and their location.  3. **Identify Relevant Tables**:    - The `Employees` table is the most relevant because it contains information about employees, including their titles and potentially their location (though the schema provided does not explicitly list a salary or country column in the Employees table).  4. **Identify Necessary Columns**:    - We need the `Title` column to filter for ""Sales Representative"".    - We need a `Country` column to filter for employees located in the United Kingdom.    - We need a `Salary` column to calculate the average salary.  5. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Use the `SELECT` statement to retrieve data.    - Use the `AVG()` function to calculate the average salary.    - Use the `WHERE` clause to filter employees who are sales representatives and are located in the UK.  6. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Based on the schema and the problem requirements, the SQL query would look like:            SELECT AVG(Salary)       FROM Employees       WHERE Title = 'Sales Representative'       AND Country = 'UK';        7. **Assumptions and Adjustments**:    - Assume that the `Employees` table has a `Salary` column, even though it is not explicitly listed in the provided schema.    - Assume that the `Country` column is part of the `Employees` table, as it is necessary to filter by location.  8. **Verify the Query**:    - Ensure that the query correctly filters employees by title and country.    - Ensure that the `AVG()` function is correctly applied to the `Salary` column.  By following these logical steps, we can construct a query that accurately calculates the average salary of sales representatives in the United Kingdom.",,

Here are the steps:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement:**    - We need to find the shipping company that is most frequently used for orders shipped to the USA.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns:**    - From the schema, the relevant tables are `Orders` and `Shippers`.    - The `Orders` table contains the `ShipperID` (which indicates which shipping company was used) and `ShipCountry` (which indicates the destination country).    - The `Shippers` table contains `ShipperID` and `ShipperName` (or `CompanyName`).  3. **Determine Necessary Joins:**    - To get the name of the shipping company, we need to join the `Orders` table with the `Shippers` table on the `ShipperID`.  4. **Filter for Relevant Data:**    - We are only interested in orders shipped to the USA, so we need to filter the `Orders` table where `ShipCountry` is 'USA'.  5. **Aggregate and Count:**    - We need to count how many times each shipping company is used for orders to the USA. This requires grouping the results by `ShipperName` (or `CompanyName`) and counting the occurrences.  6. **Sort and Limit Results:**    - To find the most widely used shipping company, sort the results by the count in descending order.    - Limit the results to the top entry to get the most frequently used shipping company.  7. **Formulate the SQL Query:**    - Using the above logic, we can construct the SQL query:            SELECT T2.ShipperName       FROM Orders AS T1       INNER JOIN Shippers AS T2 ON T1.ShipperID = T2.ShipperID       WHERE T1.ShipCountry = 'USA'       GROUP BY T2.ShipperName       ORDER BY COUNT(T2.ShipperName) DESC       LIMIT 1;        8. **Verify the Solution:**    - Ensure that the query correctly joins the tables, filters for the USA, groups by the shipping company, orders by the count, and limits the result to the top entry.  By following these steps, we can logically derive the solution to identify the most widely used shipping company for orders shipped to the USA.",,

Here’s how we can break down the process:  1. **Understand the Problem**: The task is to count the number of products supplied by a specific supplier, ""Pavlova, Ltd.""  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**: From the schema, identify the tables that are relevant to the problem:    - **Products**: This table contains information about products, including `ProductID`, `ProductName`, and `SupplierID`.    - **Suppliers**: This table contains supplier information, including `SupplierID` and `SupplierName`.  3. **Determine the Relationship**: Establish the relationship between the tables:    - The `Products` table has a `SupplierID` column that links to the `SupplierID` in the `Suppliers` table. This relationship allows us to associate each product with its supplier.  4. **Formulate the Query**:    - **Join the Tables**: Use an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Products` and `Suppliers` tables based on the `SupplierID`. This will allow us to access supplier names for each product.    - **Filter by Supplier Name**: Use a `WHERE` clause to filter the results to only include products supplied by ""Pavlova, Ltd."" This is done by checking the `SupplierName` in the `Suppliers` table.    - **Count the Products**: Use the `COUNT` function to count the number of products that meet the criteria.  5. **Write the SQL Query**:    - The SQL query is constructed as follows:            SELECT COUNT(T1.ProductName)      FROM Products AS T1      INNER JOIN Suppliers AS T2 ON T1.SupplierID = T2.SupplierID      WHERE T2.SupplierName = 'Pavlova, Ltd.'          - This query joins the `Products` and `Suppliers` tables, filters for the supplier ""Pavlova, Ltd.,"" and counts the number of products supplied by them.  6. **Verify the Solution**: Ensure that the query correctly counts the products by checking the logic and the relationships used in the query.  By following these steps, we can logically arrive at the solution to count how many products were supplied by ""Pavlova, Ltd.""",,

Here's how you might approach the problem:  1. **Understand the Schema**: Begin by reviewing the schema to understand the relevant tables and relationships. The key tables involved in this problem are `Orders`, `Customers`, and `Shippers`.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - **Orders Table**: Contains `OrderID`, `CustomerID`, and `ShipperID` (referred to as `ShipVia` in some contexts).    - **Customers Table**: Contains `CustomerID` and `CustomerName`.    - **Shippers Table**: Contains `ShipperID` and `ShipperName`.  3. **Determine the Relationships**:    - The `Orders` table links to the `Customers` table via `CustomerID`.    - The `Orders` table links to the `Shippers` table via `ShipperID`.  4. **Formulate the Query Requirements**:    - We need to count orders where the customer is ""GREAL"" and the shipper is ""United Package"".    - This requires filtering the `Orders` table based on `CustomerID` and `ShipperID`.  5. **Join the Tables**:    - Perform an INNER JOIN between the `Orders` table and the `Shippers` table to access the shipper's name.    - This is done using the `ShipperID` from the `Orders` table and `ShipperID` from the `Shippers` table.  6. **Apply the Filters**:    - Filter the joined result to include only rows where `CustomerID` is ""GREAL"".    - Filter further to include only rows where `ShipperName` is ""United Package"".  7. **Count the Orders**:    - Use the `COUNT` function to count the number of orders that meet the criteria.  8. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Combine all the steps into a single SQL query:            SELECT COUNT(T1.OrderID)      FROM Orders AS T1      INNER JOIN Shippers AS T2 ON T1.ShipVia = T2.ShipperID      WHERE T1.CustomerID = 'GREAL' AND T2.ShipperName = 'United Package';        9. **Verify and Test**:    - Ensure the query logic aligns with the schema and problem requirements.    - Test the query to verify it returns the correct count.  By following these steps, you logically arrive at the solution to the problem, ensuring that all relevant tables and conditions are considered.",,

By following these steps, we can construct the solution query:   SELECT DISTINCT T2.SupplierName  FROM Products AS T1  INNER JOIN Suppliers AS T2 ON T1.SupplierID = T2.SupplierID  WHERE T1.ReorderLevel = (SELECT MAX(ReorderLevel) FROM Products)   This query effectively identifies the suppliers whose products have the highest reorder levels, which we have inferred to be a proxy for user satisfaction.",,

This can be done by checking if the `Discontinued` column in the `Products` table is set to 1 (assuming 1 indicates a discontinued product).    - We also need to filter the suppliers to only include those located in Australia. This can be done by checking if the `Country` column in the `Suppliers` table is 'Australia'.  5. **Count the Unique Suppliers**:    - Since the problem asks for the number of suppliers, we need to count the unique suppliers that meet the criteria. This can be achieved by counting the distinct `SupplierID` values after applying the filters.  6. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Combine the above steps into a SQL query:            SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT T2.SupplierID)      FROM Products AS T1      INNER JOIN Suppliers AS T2 ON T1.SupplierID = T2.SupplierID      WHERE T1.Discontinued = 1 AND T2.Country = 'Australia';          - This query joins the `Products` and `Suppliers` tables, filters for discontinued products and suppliers in Australia, and counts the distinct suppliers that meet these conditions.  7. **Validate the Solution**:    - Ensure that the query accurately reflects the problem requirements and that it will return the correct count of suppliers with discontinued products in Australia.  By following these logical steps, we can construct a query that answers the given SQL problem efficiently.",,

In this case, the `Products` table contains a `SupplierID` which links to the `Suppliers` table.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables**:    - Determine which tables are necessary to solve the problem. Here, the `Products` and `Suppliers` tables are relevant because we need to count products supplied by each supplier.  3. **Formulate the Query**:    - Start by writing a query that counts the number of products supplied by each supplier. This involves grouping the data by `SupplierID` in the `Products` table.  4. **Join Tables**:    - Use an `INNER JOIN` to connect the `Products` table with the `Suppliers` table on `SupplierID`. This allows us to access supplier information if needed.  5. **Count Products**:    - Use the `COUNT(*)` function to count the number of products associated with each `SupplierID`. This will help determine which supplier supplies the most products.  6. **Group and Order Results**:    - Group the results by `SupplierID` to aggregate the product counts for each supplier. Then, order the results in descending order based on the product count to identify the supplier with the highest count.  7. **Limit the Results**:    - Use `LIMIT 1` to return only the top result, which corresponds to the supplier with the most products supplied.  8. **Select the Supplier Name**:    - Although the provided solution selects `SupplierID`, to answer the problem, you would typically select the `SupplierName` from the `Suppliers` table. Adjust the query to include the supplier name if needed.  9. **Verify the Solution**:    - Double-check the query logic and ensure it correctly identifies the supplier with the most products. Test the query with sample data if possible.  By following these steps, you can construct a query to find the supplier that supplies the most products to the company. The provided solution focuses on identifying the `SupplierID`, but you can modify it to retrieve the `SupplierName` as well.",,

In this case, we need information about employees and their territories.    - Notice that there is no direct mention of a table named `EmployeeTerritories` in the schema provided. However, it is implied that such a table exists to link employees to territories.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - The `Employees` table contains information about employees, including their `EmployeeID` and `Title`.    - The `EmployeeTerritories` table (implied) would contain `EmployeeID` and `TerritoryID` to link employees to their respective territories.  3. **Determine the Required Data**:    - We need to find out how many territories each employee is in charge of. This requires counting the number of `TerritoryID` entries for each `EmployeeID` in the `EmployeeTerritories` table.  4. **Join Tables**:    - Perform an INNER JOIN between the `Employees` table and the `EmployeeTerritories` table on the `EmployeeID` column. This will allow us to associate each territory with the corresponding employee.  5. **Group and Count Territories**:    - Use the `GROUP BY` clause to group the results by `Title` from the `Employees` table. This allows us to aggregate the data by employee title.    - Use the `COUNT` function to count the number of territories (`TerritoryID`) for each group.  6. **Order and Limit Results**:    - Order the results in descending order of the count of territories using the `ORDER BY COUNT(TerritoryID) DESC` clause. This ensures that the title with the highest number of territories appears first.    - Use the `LIMIT 1` clause to select only the top result, which corresponds to the title of the employee with the highest number of territories.  7. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Combine all the steps into a coherent SQL query:            SELECT T1.Title       FROM Employees AS T1       INNER JOIN EmployeeTerritories AS T2       ON T1.EmployeeID = T2.EmployeeID       GROUP BY T1.Title       ORDER BY COUNT(T2.TerritoryID) DESC       LIMIT 1;        By following these logical steps, we can effectively query the database to find the desired information.",,

Here's how we can approach the problem:  1. **Understand the Schema**:     - We have multiple tables, but the ones of interest for this problem are `Products`, `Orders`, and `OrderDetails`.    - The `Products` table contains information about each product, including `ProductID`.    - The `Orders` table contains information about each order, including `OrderID`.    - The `OrderDetails` table links products to orders with `OrderID` and `ProductID`, and it also includes the `Quantity` of each product ordered.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - To find the most ordered product, we need to focus on the `OrderDetails` table because it contains both `ProductID` and the `Quantity` ordered.    - We also need the `Products` table to get the `ProductID` and potentially other product information.  3. **Determine the Relationships**:    - The `OrderDetails` table is the bridge between `Orders` and `Products`. It connects `OrderID` from `Orders` and `ProductID` from `Products`.  4. **Formulate the Query Strategy**:    - We need to count the number of times each product appears in the `OrderDetails` table to determine which product is ordered the most.    - This requires grouping the results by `ProductID` and counting the occurrences.  5. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Use an `INNER JOIN` to connect `Products` and `OrderDetails` on `ProductID`.    - Group the results by `ProductID` to aggregate the order counts for each product.    - Use `ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC` to sort the products by the number of orders in descending order.    - Use `LIMIT 1` to get only the top product with the highest order count.  6. **Construct the Solution**:    - The final SQL query is:            SELECT T1.ProductID       FROM Products AS T1       INNER JOIN `OrderDetails` AS T2       ON T1.ProductID = T2.ProductID       GROUP BY T1.ProductID       ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC       LIMIT 1;          - This query selects the `ProductID` of the product that appears most frequently in the `OrderDetails` table, effectively identifying the most ordered product.

Here is a step-by-step logical approach to reach the solution:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: The task is to find the territory descriptions for the employee who holds a doctorate degree. This requires identifying the employee with a doctorate and then determining the territories they manage.  2. **Analyze the Schema**: Review the provided schema to identify relevant tables and columns:    - **Employees**: Contains employee details, including their educational qualifications in the 'Notes' column.    - **EmployeeTerritories**: Associates employees with territories.    - **Territories**: Contains territory descriptions.  3. **Identify the Employee with a Doctorate**:    - The 'Notes' column in the Employees table contains information about the employee's education. We need to filter employees whose 'Notes' mention a doctorate (e.g., ""Ph.D."").  4. **Locate the Employee's Territories**:    - Use the EmployeeTerritories table to find which territories are associated with the identified employee. This table links employees to territories via EmployeeID and TerritoryID.  5. **Retrieve Territory Descriptions**:    - Use the Territories table to get the descriptions of the territories managed by the employee. This table contains the TerritoryID and TerritoryDescription.  6. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - **Join Tables**: Use INNER JOIN to combine the Employees, EmployeeTerritories, and Territories tables based on matching EmployeeID and TerritoryID.    - **Filter by Doctorate**: In the WHERE clause, filter the Employees table to select only those employees whose 'Notes' column contains the keyword ""Ph.D."" or ""doctorate"".    - **Select Territory Descriptions**: Finally, select the TerritoryDescription from the Territories table.  7. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - The query should look like this:            SELECT T3.TerritoryDescription      FROM Employees AS T1      INNER JOIN EmployeeTerritories AS T2 ON T1.EmployeeID = T2.EmployeeID      INNER JOIN Territories AS T3 ON T2.TerritoryID = T3.TerritoryID      WHERE T1.Notes LIKE '%Ph.D.%'        8. **Verify the Query**:    - Ensure that the query correctly identifies the employee with a doctorate and retrieves all associated territory descriptions.  By following these logical steps, you can construct a query that accurately answers the problem statement.",,

Therefore, we should focus on the `Territories` and `Region` tables.    - Key columns needed:      - `Territories` table: `TerritoryDescription`, `RegionID`      - `Region` table: `RegionID`, `RegionDescription`  3. **Determine Relationships Between Tables**:    - The `Territories` table has a `RegionID` column that can be used to join with the `RegionID` column in the `Region` table. This relationship allows us to link territories to their respective regions.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Start with a basic `SELECT` statement to retrieve `TerritoryDescription` from the `Territories` table.    - Use an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Territories` table with the `Region` table based on the `RegionID`.    - Filter the results using a `WHERE` clause to select only those rows where `RegionDescription` is 'Eastern'.    - Use `DISTINCT` to ensure that each territory description appears only once in the result set.    - Add an `ORDER BY` clause to sort the results alphabetically by `TerritoryDescription`.  5. **Construct the Final Query**:    - Combine the above steps into the final SQL query:            SELECT DISTINCT T1.TerritoryDescription       FROM Territories AS T1       INNER JOIN Region AS T2 ON T1.RegionID = T2.RegionID       WHERE T2.RegionDescription = 'Eastern'       ORDER BY T1.TerritoryDescription;        6. **Verify the Query**:    - Review the query to ensure it logically retrieves the correct information based on the problem statement.    - Consider edge cases, such as ensuring there are no duplicate descriptions and that the join condition is correctly specified.  By following these steps, you can systematically approach the problem and construct a query that retrieves the desired information.",,

However, it is implied that there is a relationship between employees and territories through a table named `EmployeeTerritories`.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - We need information about employees and their territories.    - The `Employees` table contains employee details, including their IDs.    - The `EmployeeTerritories` table (implied) likely contains mappings between employees and territories, with columns such as `EmployeeID` and `TerritoryID`.  3. **Filter for Sales Representatives**:    - Since the problem specifically asks for sales representatives, we need to filter the employees to only include those with the title 'Sales Representative'.    - This can be done by checking the `Title` column in the `Employees` table.  4. **Calculate the Total Number of Territories**:    - To find the total number of territories that sales representatives are in charge of, we need to count the number of distinct `TerritoryID` entries for these employees.    - This involves joining the `Employees` table with the `EmployeeTerritories` table on `EmployeeID`.  5. **Count the Number of Sales Representatives**:    - We need to count the number of distinct sales representatives. This can be done by counting distinct `EmployeeID` values from the filtered list of employees.  6. **Compute the Average**:    - The average number of territories per sales representative is calculated by dividing the total number of territories by the number of sales representatives.    - Ensure the division results in a real number to avoid integer division issues.  7. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Use an SQL query to implement the above logic:            SELECT CAST(COUNT(T2.TerritoryID) AS REAL) / COUNT(DISTINCT T1.EmployeeID)      FROM Employees AS T1      INNER JOIN EmployeeTerritories AS T2 ON T1.EmployeeID = T2.EmployeeID      WHERE T1.Title = 'Sales Representative'        8. **Verify and Test the Solution**:    - Ensure the query correctly calculates the average by testing it against the database.    - Check for any edge cases, such as employees without territories or multiple territories for a single employee.  By following these steps, we can logically derive the solution to the problem of finding the average number of territories each sales representative is in charge of.",,

Here is a breakdown of the reasoning process:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: The goal is to find the beverage product with the highest customer satisfaction. This implies that we need to identify products within the 'Beverages' category and determine which one is most favored by customers.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:     - The `Categories` table contains information about product categories, including the `CategoryName` which we need to filter for 'Beverages'.    - The `Products` table contains information about products, including `ProductName`, `CategoryID`, and potentially other columns that might indicate customer satisfaction.  3. **Determine Criteria for Customer Satisfaction**:     - The problem does not explicitly define ""customer satisfaction,"" so we must infer it from available data. Common indicators might include sales volume, reorder levels, or customer reviews. In this case, we assume that a higher `ReorderLevel` in the `Products` table might indicate higher demand or satisfaction.  4. **Formulate the Query**:    - **Join Tables**: Since we need to filter products by category, join the `Products` table with the `Categories` table on `CategoryID`.    - **Filter for Beverages**: Use a `WHERE` clause to filter the results to only include products where `CategoryName` is 'Beverages'.    - **Sort by Customer Satisfaction**: Order the results by `ReorderLevel` in descending order to bring the product with the highest satisfaction to the top.    - **Select the Top Result**: Use `LIMIT 1` to select only the top product from the sorted list.  5. **Write the SQL Query**:        SELECT T1.ProductName     FROM Products AS T1     INNER JOIN Categories AS T2 ON T1.CategoryID = T2.CategoryID     WHERE T2.CategoryName = 'Beverages'     ORDER BY T1.ReorderLevel DESC     LIMIT 1;      6. **Validate the Solution**: Ensure that the query correctly identifies the product with the highest reorder level among beverages, as this is our proxy for customer satisfaction.  By following these steps, we systematically narrow down the data to answer the problem statement effectively.",,

This relationship allows us to determine which employee handled each order.  2. **Determine the Required Output:**    - We need the full name (first and last name) of the employee who handled the most orders. This requires counting the number of orders each employee handled and then identifying the employee with the highest count.  3. **Formulate the SQL Query:**    - **Join the Tables:** Use an `INNER JOIN` to combine the `Employees` and `Orders` tables based on the `EmployeeID`. This will allow us to associate each order with the corresponding employee.    - **Group the Data:** Use `GROUP BY` to aggregate the data by `FirstName` and `LastName` of the employees. This will help in counting the number of orders handled by each employee.    - **Count the Orders:** Use the `COUNT(*)` function to count the number of orders for each employee.    - **Order the Results:** Use `ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC` to sort the employees based on the number of orders they handled, in descending order. This ensures that the employee with the highest number of orders appears first.    - **Limit the Output:** Use `LIMIT 1` to select only the top result, which corresponds to the employee with the highest order count.  4. **Construct the SQL Query:**    - Combine the above steps into a coherent SQL query:            SELECT T1.FirstName, T1.LastName      FROM Employees AS T1      INNER JOIN Orders AS T2 ON T1.EmployeeID = T2.EmployeeID      GROUP BY T1.FirstName, T1.LastName      ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC      LIMIT 1        5. **Verify and Test:**    - Ensure the query is syntactically correct and test it against the database to verify that it returns the expected results.  By following these steps, we logically arrive at the solution to the problem, ensuring that we correctly identify the employee who handled the highest number of orders.",,

Here are the logical steps to arrive at the solution:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement:**    - We need to find the seafood product with the highest total production. This implies we need to focus on products categorized as ""Seafood"" and determine which one has the highest production quantity.  2. **Analyze the Schema:**    - Examine the provided schema to identify relevant tables and columns:      - **Categories Table:** Contains `CategoryID` and `CategoryName`. We need this to filter products that belong to the ""Seafood"" category.      - **Products Table:** Contains `ProductID`, `ProductName`, `CategoryID`, and potentially other columns that might indicate production quantities.  3. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns:**    - We need to join the **Products** and **Categories** tables to filter products by category name.    - We need to identify the column(s) in the **Products** table that represent the production quantity. Common columns that might indicate production are `UnitsInStock` and `UnitsOnOrder`.  4. **Formulate the SQL Query:**    - **Join the Tables:** Use an INNER JOIN to connect the **Products** and **Categories** tables on `CategoryID`.    - **Filter by Category:** Use a WHERE clause to filter products where `CategoryName` is ""Seafood"".    - **Calculate Total Production:** Assume total production is represented by the sum of `UnitsInStock` and `UnitsOnOrder`.    - **Sort and Limit:** Order the results by the calculated total production in descending order and limit the result to the top entry to find the product with the highest production.  5. **Write the SQL Query:**        SELECT T1.ProductName    FROM Products AS T1    INNER JOIN Categories AS T2 ON T1.CategoryID = T2.CategoryID    WHERE T2.CategoryName = 'Seafood'    ORDER BY T1.UnitsInStock + T1.UnitsOnOrder DESC    LIMIT 1;      6. **Verify the Solution:**    - Ensure the query correctly joins the tables, filters by the ""Seafood"" category, calculates the total production, and retrieves the product with the highest production.

In this case, we need information about employees and the territories they manage.    - The `Employees` table contains employee details including `EmployeeID` and `Salary`.    - The `EmployeeTerritories` table (not explicitly mentioned in the schema but implied) would likely contain `EmployeeID` and `TerritoryID`, linking employees to the territories they manage.  2. **Identify the Key Relationships**:    - We need to determine how many territories each employee is in charge of. This requires a relationship between `Employees` and `EmployeeTerritories`.  3. **Formulate the Query to Count Territories**:    - Use an `INNER JOIN` between `Employees` and `EmployeeTerritories` on `EmployeeID` to link each employee to their territories.    - Use `GROUP BY` to group the results by `EmployeeID` and `Salary`, allowing us to count the number of territories per employee.  4. **Order and Limit the Results**:    - Use `ORDER BY COUNT(TerritoryID) DESC` to sort the employees by the number of territories they manage in descending order.    - Use `LIMIT 2` to select only the top 2 employees with the most territories.  5. **Calculate the Salary Difference**:    - From the subquery that retrieves the top 2 employees, select their salaries.    - Use `MAX(Salary) - MIN(Salary)` to calculate the difference between the highest and lowest salary among these top 2 employees.  6. **Construct the Final Query**:    - Combine all the steps into a single SQL query that calculates the desired salary difference.    - Ensure the subquery correctly retrieves the top 2 employees based on territory count, and the outer query calculates the salary difference.  By following these steps, we can construct the solution query:   SELECT MAX(Salary) - MIN(Salary)  FROM (     SELECT T1.Salary      FROM Employees AS T1      INNER JOIN EmployeeTerritories AS T2 ON T1.EmployeeID = T2.EmployeeID      GROUP BY T1.EmployeeID, T1.Salary      ORDER BY COUNT(T2.TerritoryID) DESC      LIMIT 2 ) T1;   This query effectively finds the difference in salary between the top 2 employees with the most territories under their management.",,

In this case, the `Customers` table is of interest because it contains information about customers, including their company names and cities.  2. **Identify the Objective**:    - The goal is to find the city with the most customers and then list the company names of customers from that city.  3. **Determine the Necessary Data**:    - We need to count the number of customers in each city. This requires grouping the data by the `City` column in the `Customers` table.  4. **Write a Subquery to Find the City with the Most Customers**:    - Use a subquery to group the customers by city and count the number of customers in each city.    - Sort the results in descending order based on the count to identify the city with the highest number of customers.    - Use `LIMIT 1` to select the city with the most customers.         SELECT City     FROM Customers     GROUP BY City     ORDER BY COUNT(CustomerID) DESC     LIMIT 1      5. **Use the Subquery to Filter the Main Query**:    - Use the result of the subquery to filter the main query that selects the company names.    - The main query should select `CustomerName` from the `Customers` table where the `City` matches the city identified in the subquery.         SELECT CustomerName     FROM Customers     WHERE City = (        SELECT City         FROM Customers         GROUP BY City         ORDER BY COUNT(CustomerID) DESC         LIMIT 1    )      6. **Review and Optimize**:    - Ensure the query is efficient and correctly formatted.    - Verify that the subquery correctly identifies the city with the most customers and that the main query accurately retrieves the company names from that city.

This means the oldest employees should appear first.  2. **Identify Relevant Table**: From the given schema, identify which table contains the necessary information. The `Employees` table includes columns for `FirstName`, `LastName`, and `BirthDate`, which are relevant for constructing the full name and determining age. However, the contact number (presumably `HomePhone`) is not listed in the provided schema, so we will assume it is meant to be included based on typical employee records.  3. **Determine Columns Needed**: We need to select the `FirstName`, `LastName`, and `HomePhone` columns to fulfill the requirement of displaying the full name and contact number.  4. **Calculate Age**: Age is determined by the `BirthDate`. To sort employees by age in descending order, we need to sort by `BirthDate` in ascending order (older birthdates mean older employees).  5. **Construct Full Name**: The full name is constructed by combining `FirstName` and `LastName`. In SQL, this can be done by selecting both columns separately or concatenating them.  6. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Start with the `SELECT` statement to choose the necessary columns: `FirstName`, `LastName`, and `HomePhone`.    - Use the `FROM` clause to specify the `Employees` table.    - Use the `ORDER BY` clause to sort the results by `BirthDate` in ascending order to achieve a descending order of age.  7. **Final Query**: The final SQL query is:        SELECT FirstName, LastName, HomePhone FROM Employees ORDER BY BirthDate ASC;        Note: The provided solution uses `ORDER BY BirthDate DESC`, which implies sorting by the most recent birthdate first, contrary to the requirement. Thus, the correct logic should use `ASC` to sort by age in descending order.  8. **Review and Adjust**: Ensure that the query aligns with the problem requirements and adjust if necessary. Since the schema did not list `HomePhone`, verify its existence in the actual database schema if possible.

Here’s how you can approach it:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to calculate the average price of products that are shipped to the UK.  2. **Analyze the Schema**:    - Review the tables and their columns to identify which ones are relevant to the problem. The key tables appear to be `Customers`, `Orders`, `OrderDetails`, and `Products`.  3. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - **Customers**: Contains `CustomerID` and `Country`, which will help us identify orders shipped to the UK.    - **Orders**: Links customers to specific orders via `CustomerID`.    - **OrderDetails**: Contains `OrderID`, `ProductID`, and `Quantity`, which are necessary to find the products in each order.    - **Products**: Contains `ProductID` and `Price`, which are needed to determine the price of each product.  4. **Determine the Relationships**:    - Orders are linked to customers through `CustomerID`.    - Order details are linked to orders through `OrderID`.    - Products are linked to order details through `ProductID`.  5. **Filter the Data**:    - We need to filter orders to only include those shipped to the UK. This involves joining the `Customers` table with the `Orders` table and filtering by `Country = 'UK'`.  6. **Calculate the Average Price**:    - After filtering the orders, join with `OrderDetails` to get the `ProductID` and `Quantity`.    - Join with `Products` to get the `Price`.    - Calculate the average price of these products.  7. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - The query needs to join the necessary tables and apply the filter for the UK.    - Use the `AVG()` function to calculate the average price of the products.  8. **Consider the Solution Provided**:    - The solution uses a table named `Invoices`, which is not explicitly mentioned in the schema provided. This suggests that `Invoices` might be a view or derived table that already joins `Orders`, `OrderDetails`, `Products`, and `Customers` and includes the `UnitPrice` and `Country`.    - The query `SELECT AVG(UnitPrice) AS avg FROM Invoices WHERE Country = 'UK'` is a simplified solution assuming `Invoices` contains all necessary data.  9. **Validate the Solution**:    - Ensure that the `Invoices` view or table correctly represents the necessary joins and contains the `UnitPrice` and `Country` fields.    - Verify that the `Country` filter correctly isolates orders shipped to the UK.  By following these steps, you can logically derive the solution to calculate the average price of products shipped to the UK using the given schema and problem statement.",,

Here's a breakdown of the logical steps that could have been taken to reach the solution:  1. **Understand the Problem**:     - We need to determine which product has been sold the most across all orders. This involves calculating the total quantity sold for each product and identifying the product with the highest total.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - From the schema, the relevant tables are `OrderDetails` and `Products`.    - The `OrderDetails` table contains `ProductID` and `Quantity`, which are crucial for calculating the total quantity sold for each product.  3. **Determine Necessary Operations**:    - We need to aggregate data to calculate the total quantity sold for each product. This requires a `GROUP BY` operation on `ProductID`.    - We need to sum the `Quantity` for each `ProductID` to get the total quantity sold.  4. **Sort and Limit the Results**:    - After calculating the total quantities, we need to sort the results in descending order to find the product with the highest total quantity sold.    - Use `ORDER BY SUM(Quantity) DESC` to sort the products by total quantity sold in descending order.    - Use `LIMIT 1` to select only the top product with the highest total quantity sold.  5. **Formulate the SQL Query**:    - Combine the above steps into a SQL query:            SELECT ProductID       FROM `OrderDetails`       GROUP BY ProductID       ORDER BY SUM(Quantity) DESC       LIMIT 1;          - This query groups the order details by `ProductID`, calculates the sum of `Quantity` for each product, sorts the results in descending order of total quantity, and selects the top product.  6. **Verify and Validate**:    - Ensure that the query correctly identifies the product with the highest total quantity sold by testing it against sample data or a subset of the database.

These are in the `Suppliers` table as `SupplierName`, `Address`, and `Phone`.    - **From Clause**: Start with the `Products` table because we need to filter products based on their price.    - **Join Clause**: Use an `INNER JOIN` to connect the `Products` table with the `Suppliers` table on the `SupplierID` column. This will allow us to access supplier information for products.    - **Where Clause**: Add a condition to filter products where the `Price` is greater than 30.  5. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Use the identified columns and relationships to construct the SQL query:            SELECT T2.SupplierName, T2.Address, T2.Phone      FROM Products AS T1      INNER JOIN Suppliers AS T2 ON T1.SupplierID = T2.SupplierID      WHERE T1.Price > 30;        6. **Verify the Query**:    - Ensure that the query correctly retrieves the desired information by checking the logic and ensuring all necessary conditions are included.

Here are the logical steps to arrive at the solution:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to list the company names and addresses of customers who have paid more than the average freight.     - This requires calculating the average freight and comparing each customer's freight payment against this average.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - We need information from the `Customers` and `Orders` tables.    - From `Customers`, we need `CustomerID`, `CompanyName`, and `Address`.    - From `Orders`, we need `CustomerID` and `Freight`.  3. **Calculate the Average Freight**:    - Use the `Orders` table to calculate the average freight across all orders.    - This can be done using the `AVG()` function in SQL.  4. **Filter Customers Based on Freight Payment**:    - We need to find customers whose freight payment is greater than the calculated average.    - This involves filtering the `Orders` table where `Freight` is greater than the average freight.  5. **Join Tables to Get Customer Information**:    - Use an `INNER JOIN` to combine `Customers` and `Orders` tables based on the `CustomerID`.    - This join will allow us to access customer details for orders that meet the freight condition.  6. **Select Required Columns**:    - From the joined result, select `CompanyName` and `Address` from the `Customers` table.    - Use `DISTINCT` to ensure that each customer appears only once in the result set, even if they have multiple orders exceeding the average freight.  7. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Combine the above steps into a coherent SQL query:            SELECT DISTINCT T1.CompanyName, T1.Address      FROM Customers AS T1      INNER JOIN Orders AS T2 ON T1.CustomerID = T2.CustomerID      WHERE T2.Freight > (        SELECT AVG(Freight) FROM Orders      )        By following these steps, we ensure that the query accurately retrieves the desired information about customers who have paid more than the average freight.",,

This relationship allows us to join these tables.  4. **Filter Products That Are Discontinued**:    - We need to find products that are discontinued. This can be done by checking the `Discontinued` column in the `Products` table, where a value of `1` indicates a product is discontinued.  5. **Filter Suppliers That Are Non-US**:    - After identifying discontinued products, we need to ensure that the suppliers of these products are not based in the USA. This can be checked using the `Country` column in the `Suppliers` table.  6. **Join Tables to Combine Information**:    - Use an `INNER JOIN` between `Products` and `Suppliers` on the `SupplierID` to combine product and supplier information.  7. **Select and Distinctly List Supplier Names**:    - After filtering for discontinued products and non-US suppliers, select the `SupplierName` from the `Suppliers` table.    - Use `DISTINCT` to ensure each supplier is listed only once, even if they have multiple discontinued products.  8. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Combine all the above steps into a single SQL query:            SELECT DISTINCT T2.SupplierName      FROM Products AS T1      INNER JOIN Suppliers AS T2 ON T1.SupplierID = T2.SupplierID      WHERE T1.Discontinued = 1 AND T2.Country != 'USA';        By following these logical steps, we can systematically arrive at the solution to the problem.",,

Here is a breakdown of the thought process:  1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to identify the top five most costly products based on orders made in 1998. The cost of a product can be determined by its unit price and any associated freight costs.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - **Orders**: This table contains the `OrderDate`, which we need to filter orders from 1998.    - **OrderDetails**: This table links orders to products via `OrderID` and `ProductID`. It also contains the `Quantity` of each product ordered.    - **Products**: This table contains the `ProductName` and `Price` (which should be referred to as `UnitPrice` in the SQL solution).  3. **Determine Necessary Joins**:    - We need to join the `Orders` table with the `OrderDetails` table to get the details of each order.    - We then join the `OrderDetails` table with the `Products` table to get the product names and prices.  4. **Filter Orders by Year**:    - Use the `OrderDate` from the `Orders` table to filter for orders made in 1998. This can be done using a `LIKE` clause with '1998%' to capture all dates in that year.  5. **Calculate Cost for Each Product**:    - The cost of a product in an order can be calculated by considering its `UnitPrice` and any associated freight costs. However, the solution provided does not include freight costs, which is a discrepancy. Assuming the solution intends to rank by product price, we should focus on `UnitPrice`.  6. **Order and Limit Results**:    - Order the results by the calculated cost (or `UnitPrice` if freight is not considered) in descending order to get the most costly products at the top.    - Use `LIMIT 5` to restrict the results to the top five products.  7. **Select the Required Output**:    - Finally, select the `ProductName` from the `Products` table to display the names of the top five costly products.  By following these steps, we can construct the SQL query that meets the problem's requirements. The provided solution seems to have a slight error in the calculation of cost by including `T1.Freight`, which is not present in the schema. The correct approach should focus on `UnitPrice` from the `Products` table.",,

Here are the steps:  1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:     - We need to find out which supplier supplies the most distinct products. This implies counting the number of products each supplier provides and identifying the supplier with the highest count.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - From the schema, the `Products` table and the `Suppliers` table are relevant.    - The `Products` table contains `ProductID`, `ProductName`, and `SupplierID`.    - The `Suppliers` table contains `SupplierID` and `SupplierName`.  3. **Determine the Relationship**:    - The `SupplierID` in the `Products` table is a foreign key that references the `SupplierID` in the `Suppliers` table. This relationship allows us to join these tables.  4. **Plan the SQL Query**:    - We need to join the `Products` table with the `Suppliers` table using the `SupplierID`.    - Count the number of products each supplier provides. This can be done using the `COUNT()` function on `ProductName` or `ProductID` after grouping by `SupplierID`.  5. **Group and Aggregate Data**:    - Use `GROUP BY` on `SupplierID` and `SupplierName` to aggregate the data for each supplier.    - Use `COUNT()` to calculate the number of products each supplier supplies.  6. **Order and Limit the Results**:    - Order the results in descending order based on the count of products to identify the supplier with the most products.    - Use `LIMIT 1` to get the top result, which is the supplier with the highest count of products.  7. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Combine all these steps into a coherent SQL query:            SELECT T2.SupplierName       FROM Products AS T1       INNER JOIN Suppliers AS T2 ON T1.SupplierID = T2.SupplierID       GROUP BY T2.SupplierID, T2.SupplierName       ORDER BY COUNT(T1.ProductName) DESC       LIMIT 1;        8. **Verify the Query**:    - Ensure the query logic aligns with the problem statement and that it correctly identifies the supplier with the most products.    - Check the syntax and test the query against the database to confirm it returns the expected result.  By following these logical steps, we can systematically approach the problem and derive the correct SQL solution.",,

Specifically, note that:      - `Orders` table contains `OrderID`, `OrderDate`, and `ShipperID`.      - `OrderDetails` table contains `OrderID`, `ProductID`, and `UnitPrice`.      - `Shippers` table contains `ShipperID` and `ShipperName`.    - Recognize that the `Orders` table is linked to the `OrderDetails` table via `OrderID` and to the `Shippers` table via `ShipperID`.  2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:    - Determine which tables and columns are necessary for the query:      - From `Orders`, we need `OrderID`, `OrderDate`, and `ShipperID`.      - From `OrderDetails`, we need `OrderID` and `UnitPrice`.      - From `Shippers`, we need `ShipperID` and `ShipperName`.  3. **Formulate the Join Conditions**:    - To link the necessary data, establish join conditions:      - Join `Orders` and `OrderDetails` on `OrderID`.      - Join `Orders` and `Shippers` on `ShipperID`.  4. **Filter the Data**:    - Apply filters to extract only the relevant data:      - Filter `Orders` by `OrderDate` to include only orders from 1997. Use the condition `OrderDate LIKE '1997%'`.      - Filter `Shippers` by `ShipperName` to include only those shipped via ""United Package"".  5. **Calculate the Average Unit Price**:    - Once the relevant data is filtered, calculate the average of `UnitPrice` from the `OrderDetails` table.  6. **Construct the SQL Query**:    - Combine all the steps into a coherent SQL query:            SELECT AVG(T2.UnitPrice)      FROM Orders AS T1      INNER JOIN OrderDetails AS T2 ON T1.OrderID = T2.OrderID      INNER JOIN Shippers AS T3 ON T1.ShipperID = T3.ShipperID      WHERE T1.OrderDate LIKE '1997%'      AND T3.ShipperName = 'United Package';        7. **Review and Validate**:    - Double-check the query to ensure all conditions are correctly applied and the logic aligns with the problem statement.    - Validate the query against the database to ensure it returns the expected results.  By following these steps, you can systematically approach and solve the problem using SQL.",,

In this case, the `Orders` and `Shippers` tables are relevant.    - The `Orders` table contains the `ShipperID` (referred to as `ShipVia`), which indicates which shipper was used for each order.    - The `Shippers` table contains the `ShipperID` and `ShipperName`, which allows us to identify the shipper by name.  2. **Identify the Key Columns**:    - From the `Orders` table, the `ShipVia` column is crucial as it tells us which shipper was used for each order.    - From the `Shippers` table, the `ShipperName` column is necessary to filter orders shipped by ""Speedy Express"".  3. **Determine the Total Number of Orders**:    - To find the percentage, we need the total number of orders. This can be achieved by counting all entries in the `Orders` table.  4. **Filter Orders Shipped by Speedy Express**:    - Use a `JOIN` operation between `Orders` and `Shippers` on `ShipperID` to associate each order with its corresponding shipper name.    - Apply a `CASE` statement or a `WHERE` clause to count only the orders where the `ShipperName` is ""Speedy Express"".  5. **Calculate the Percentage**:    - Count the number of orders shipped by Speedy Express.    - Divide this count by the total number of orders and multiply by 100 to get the percentage.  6. **Write the SQL Query**:    - Use a `SELECT` statement with an aggregate function to count the total orders and the orders shipped by Speedy Express.    - Use `CAST` to ensure the division results in a real number for accurate percentage calculation.  7. **Formulate the Final Query**:    - Combine all the above steps into a single SQL query:            SELECT CAST(COUNT(CASE WHEN T2.ShipperName = 'Speedy Express' THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(T1.ShipVia)      FROM Orders AS T1      INNER JOIN Shippers AS T2 ON T1.ShipVia = T2.ShipperID;          - This query calculates the percentage of orders shipped by Speedy Express by dividing the count of such orders by the total number of orders and multiplying by 100.
